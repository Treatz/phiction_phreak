if he were given
and he would just as soon
now there were
in his hand was a
to rest
but something he said
ever since he
making as little noise as he could
and so did the fact that
but he was certain he could
and he did not look at it
just enough time
and it seemed
he also saw the
he was getting
he had decided that
might be more inclined to
that now he
beside it
substituting for
knew nothing about it
whatever else he thought of
but both were
too obvious
they stopped
out from
like most people
and the only
for a moment he had seen
get a better look at
reading between the lines
was you never knew
right to
said to
but they had everything else
this one was similar to
watching the approach of
but now they made him
especially when there was a
just before he finished
it seemed just as
he thought he meant
there was also
his hands
in one of these
he hesitated then
wasn't sure he could
not enough to cause
made it sound like
he was taken aback by
him for
was the same as
could make it to
but before he could make it to
put them on the
and even
what was he supposed to do
that's how he felt now
a lot
and there
now he saw
his car
had this was
it meant that he
eventually of course
or perhaps he was just
it had probably
it had been awhile since
but it was so difficult to
and never thought he ever would
knocked on the door and waited
he could see that there were
he would have chosen
he found himself still
only a few hours after
would have had
but there wasn't much he could do
had been slow to react
even now his decision
saw that there
it was a cruel trick
moving away from
need to know
he would not be afraid of
it wasn't that hard to
along one side of the
he had to think about that
he looked just as he remembered him
he seemed to have
to be that was
nodded slowly
and carried him away
to had no
he accelerated down an
he noticed that
as much as it was
in both
changed the subject
which helped him to
then he could turn around and
would need to be even more careful
him to see
the there was
when they
was still there was
could never be
it automatically
was easier
maybe he would have
even though it was
he didn't want to make him think that
something was about to happen
looked as if
which as
man was
just as quickly
but this time
no one would believe
made no sense
none of which he could
so they could not be
would have objected but
ahead of
but he could
it didn't look like a
and he would
another shot
for those in need of
but there was no way to
and even if there had been
suddenly it was as though
as they drove past
was always the one to
impossible to
than there ever was
he was surprised to see
like some kind of
wondered why he was being so
because it was
managed to
only he no longer
know how
he thought that was
so they all
before him
safely tucked away
on account of a
the only way out was
but he was surprised at
lights turn on
was only part of the
but then something else
be found
can there be
to think that
and attempting to smile
looked like an upscale
theoretically it was
aware of the he
had been sitting here for awhile
as he started down
he was lucky it had not
stepped back into the
they were willing to
it seemed he was being
but he hesitated before
didn't touch it
but the fact that he was
that it didn't matter
was reduced to
he finally stopped
and the man
that was he didn't
then went to
had never before been
there was nothing to it
had been too thoroughly
by product of
he had never even told
not in the way that
for a time he
listening to the
he saw their
as fast as a
has to find
was surrounded by
it had begun to
was all that
he was afraid of what
late nights
and one of the
realized that they
had happened to
but it made him
it was really
and it was the first
most of them were
he didn't see how it would
so he had to decide what
seemed like more than it
he was doing
he heard the sound of far off
and he lay there struggling
was not just
he heard the distant
as he but
he was not good at
do was the
who was still
didn't have to
he also though he'd
it was the kind of thing he
he wished he knew more about
it was advanced enough
down the
know how to respond
of it
the first thing he had
him from
talked about the
and had
made sure of that when
until they reached
once he remembered
when there is the
before they
always seemed to
that was that
place in the
it was difficult not being able to
an air of

he didn't know that was
at the other
perhaps on some level he was right
as if he were
then it was time
within minutes they were
it made sense that
of there was a
and he watched as
only made him
once more the
would go elsewhere
but as it was
for the next
somehow he couldn't help but
were packed with
but now it looked as if
hadn't even
more to it than
keeping not only
looked through the
and he didn't even remember
one of those
he only seemed to be
wondered what it must be like
might be expected to
that was the trouble
as if it were part of him
and rather different
was the best
he squinted at the
he told himself
but the rest of the
well two could play that game
he watched him until
and once
would be no
out of all this
offered no opposition
and then it
because he simply wasn't
the rest of
down the as he
he went out for
this wasn't the same as
flipped open his phone
uses to track every bit of data
took a few seconds
not the
that looked like a
the feeling was
there might be something in the
undid the
and this would be
he realized that if
and how was everyone
it seemed particulary
makes you see
what it would be like to
than what he had seen before
saw a
that there was something
but he didn't see him
been more
knew that his
and some
it was enough
who let him off of the
rumors had been heard
but he would have been
through the looking
the door behind him
going back
was stirring his coffee when
in favor of a
part of him that
although he was careful not to
he could always tell when
didn't think
the and he saw
with one last
and came to the conclusion that
to call
then used it to
with any luck
that much was clear
he had always wanted to
stumbled across the street
never would have had
and also many
took a moment to
because he knew that
until it was
made him shiver
how had he gotten
they never let him
but something about the
a very modern
was trained never to
or perhaps by some kind of
as has been said
began to turn
he looked to the
find that
there had been a

seconds to it took

just about anyone could

took them through the

he did something that he very seldom did
stepping away from the

crowded into the

to hide
and never considered

he had learned to

took him a moment to
but there was too much at stake
that he was

the one he
as he walked into the room
removed from the

as he well knew
but fortunately
it wasn't enough
he seemed to lack

looks typical for

and from a large
judging by his
to it was too
he couldn't say no
he looked down at the screen
and an
away from
excused himself to
everything that had happened was
when he saw something
go along with
he imagined himself
there was also the problem of
although he realized
later that same day
he would have preferred to go on
then pulled him aside
how has it been going
can't get back in until
he was glad he never had to
charges his phone in the cigarette
had found out
over heats
of things
as he exited the
without a pause
he was worried he wouldn't

he felt better
its much more
that looked just like a
not everyone is interested in
which would cause him
he stopped to look at a

he was afraid of what he might find
the weight of a

but now wasn't the time
was different from his

when it had finished
didn't see
isn't an option
could only mean
and he finally
of course he was not the first
and he was glad that
could be something to worry about
he did not complain
and saw he
in their own right
get a better
where he had acquired
a few minuets later they were at
was his chance
made an effort to
even less
a moment for
out his
it was plain that
at least when he
when it was noticed
for a moment he was caught off
he was able to
and he had no idea how to
after such a
never been able to
can do a search
a sort of
in both directions
could it have been
and now he was
but he had been
by sheer chance
to know he was
after a moment he
and since he was
and as the
he knew that if
which worried him
would not take long
few seconds
me the
the case
and waited to see if
he was also

he had already shown that
he still hadn't told him about
but of course the
could be used
had yet to be
had turned into
but neither was being
motioned for him to come forward
came over him
that and he was
it would never end
if one
he looked and saw the other
he realized
then upload it to
you couldn't even
which he would
in time to see
with as
it had not all been
he needed some extra
even for
that would have been true had
until he had reached
reached into his pocket
thrust his hand into his jacket
part of the
he would leave everything behind
it didn't matter that he was
made his way across the
him for a moment
the fact was that
as fast as he
must finally have
every time the
even before
he was getting nowhere
walked into it
at one point
now that was done
that were
did not realize until
seemed uncertain what to do next
as if this could
lived nearby
to be like he
had not brought much
he didn't even know why he
he was no
no doubt the reason for
a lot could happen in
he had a plan
he showed
he knew they would have to
at last the girls who had
he took his keys from the ignition
when he encountered
control over
leaving just a few
he remembered being
at least while
at them
for a long time he did not
held in each hand
he knew they would
and it really wasn't a
he wanted to he
as long as it could
it applies as much to the
wondered what he did when
and did not seem to
he half wondered
to have so little
adrift in a
in a way he just wanted to
allow him to
and now
for the first time he noticed that
how he might get back
could take it as a
he lunged for the
it could take a
couple of
just wanted to
but it seemed unlikely
it was true that
quietly pulled a
there was going to be
and he liked her at once
he didn't know whether to be
still not convinced that
think that
the rest of the day
after a while he began to
upon the
that but he was
time and energy
now it seemed
all had
any sign of
the road curved
going to was

his mind sped frantically
had proven himself to be
he'd simply assumed the
was not a likely
never had been
so quickly that a
never been in
in the hope that the
he didn't recognize
didn't have to so
but sometimes he
while there were
that wasn't there before
nothing to do with
so he felt safe
could feel his
would be worth
and somehow he
now it was his turn to
far from the
making him wonder whether
which it just had
but when the money ran out
wasn't exactly a
or maybe he just did it because
with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth
and now somehow he was
wondered what it
even though he was
but it did require
he could end up back in
to aware
once that was done
not enough to be noticeable
of which were
the way he was
who had not yet
he had not noticed him because
better yet was the
it looked like the

perhaps it would be best if
in your brain
a bonfire burned at the
outside of

would be unforgivable
and entering into

to do it
he started the

to the rear lobby
by the time he left the
and had a new
much more seriously than
it seemed to be

there was absolutely no way
that allowed them to be

then again he had done nothing
he found some

there was a distinct

when it went public

he had something else to do

this was intentional
while his thoughts

he used his credit card
he had another

which was buzzing with

it could only be
while he wrestled with
and went out without saying anything
in the world
it was impossible to say
that went all the way
he checked for
he was going to lose his

how much of this
wherever he was now

to make sure

except he'd already done all that
it would have been all to easy
he had before
that one was going to

he left them alone

he was both frightened and excited
and that's when he

grew more certain

when the time came
turned back to the computer screen
put together

there seemed
he couldn't see the
even as he
has recognized
that much at least
even though there was
like a it
but he had other things on his mind
even more vulnerable

he got more nervous
and were using that for
if they got things wrong

he turned to find

when it first
instead of

it was what made it
and whatever it might need
in no time he
especially not now
wasn't surprised to see
brimming with
for he had not been trying to
a better look
saw that there was a

that he was now certain
then directed him to a

were out on a

and not long after
and he went back to
he wouldn't have to
as fast as they could be
looking directly out into the
if one cannot
but no matter how
which was scary enough
which he would have
streaming in toward him
and resisted the urge to

down to the loading docks
anyone could

he might have jeopardized

it was his job to
what he had suspected

he would have known what to do

the usual

he had somehow never
he had always been much more
a few days ago he had been
save for where the
he had forgotten the
his chances of getting away alive were
for many
but he seemed
how much

he did not tell him that
and there was some
he had been the
the sky
it might make it harder for
by the time he had finished
five minutes
had the upper hand
had passed
he was watching them now from the
it was comforting
according to plan
for anyone with so much
knew he was not
or something near to it
it had been days since
discussion of
as if it were just another
so there was something left of
he could not understand
had not much more
and apparently he had not
he told himself to
he wasn't sure whether
back of
today it was different
in the old days he would have
he wasn't the only
now out of the
was sometimes
he was sure of that
which was of course true
there was a chance
where there had once been
was careful
it didn't matter if
it simply wasn't
but how would he
he was looking down at
but he didn't know whether
someone else
did not see it move
then for a time
so that for an instant
and how he had
every sign
but went to it
to get through the
who always seemed to
he could not take his eyes off
at one time
nothing of it
something he already knew
every bit as
not one of
when sufficient
were all around him
or to something even more
once in
tried to act as if
the door swung open
at least it had stopped
since everyone
weren't supposed
far the
as he always had
will be made
but he was only
it was rather
the purpose of this
it was hard not to
to be having

assured him that
but he
it was so quiet
he was happy to
the lock
like so many
sometimes it was better to
legend had it that
knew what he was doing
the document
the key to
but he couldn't help but
glanced at
suddenly excited by
since he knew
then he went to open
wondered how
would be of far more use to
would explain that
he wasn't going to elaborate
was to
looked the same as ever
though that wasn't
for a moment he thought he might
and if it really was
later he
he looked so much like
when he first walked into the
just as he did after
a very
and that was how
welcomed whatever
he needed to have
as it should have
his mouth
then he got out of his car
now it was just another
can't log back on
it had everybody
of the night
to show
are made to
as if he was going to
and then before he could
he understood how
resuming his progress toward
he had suspected something
handed them to
waiting for him to
he felt such a wave of
the flow of information
he was no better than the
began once more
could take away the
and he was a
reluctantly he
he didn't even bother to
he emerged into an
he looked around at
least it was
least he had
else was
coming back to
he raced back to the
he could have just
he had seen it in the
which looked like
observing for the first time the
what he would really like
the same thing he
like all the others
indicated that he should sit
strained to
for he knew that
as their own
he already knew that
it was years since he'd
showed that even in the
it was the least he could do
but in his presence
a computer
then tucked it away
it seemed to be a
was but he knew
was glad
last of all
all of them shared
but the one
had not been able to
was much larger than the
hadn't even felt
as though it had
as he was not
staring at a
this time he saw
that whole day
he must have thought
but it all depended on
trying to make the most of the
that it had a
all he had
that would have been far more
the trouble was he didn't know what
these people were not very
he knew there were several
in most cases
that he had seen
after which
he had never been to the
the closer to the
he had already been
and he couldn't let
took almost ten minuets to
he couldn't escape
maybe now he
everything he'd done so far had been
he felt the need to
he was much the same as
every time he tried to
was eerily quiet
while thinking about the
but it was just
that sort of
time was short
as some of them
he felt at home
from the moment he saw her
so that
owes more money than
and had begun
the condition of his
he couldn't help it
couldn't go much longer without
at the back of
as he watched
as though there were
they would assume that
had been emotionally
there was something missing
long for the
had cleared out all the
he scarcely had time to
did not see it
not dare to
and looked away into the
a few seconds
how much he had
he must know he has
obvious that he was
he had somehow not
evidently they had just
guarding the entrance to
in each
since he only
he tried the
he looked like he was about to
no matter what
how could he have
when he finished his
soon enough he was
but that the
and he could
they could see the
since there could be
didn't know why
was kept secret from
interest in had
place to
there might still be some
to where
seemed very far
who was as much
never actually tried
he allowed himself a
which allowed him to
years had gone by and this was
and while the
it could be used for
would surely be the
had become fairly
the ones that
but the chances of anything now
did not see
which would be immediately
was no reason
it hardly
so there was one thing
had a feeling that he had
be waiting
he had never seen
way he could there was
he thought that he
and where it might lead him
was clear to
something he would really like to avoid
a while in
then it was time for
for it was good to have
but the few people
when he came back
he was the first
happening to
this was supposed to be
he was going to find a way
this time his look was one of
all of the above
almost exactly as he had
eventually he found
which had been
this time he didn't
what is the
then he had an idea
that seemed to
was not just a
her
no reason to
quit and took another job
but he found himself
made him
so that it could
but only the
could he explain
to see that
the other
was not the type to
when dawn finally arrived
and wondered what had come of it
he quickly realized that
didn't exactly help
behind which the
surprised to see
like now
had to complicate things
look like a
as to
which probably made it
perhaps they would
had a keen interest in
exactly like the
everything stopped
it felt as
he hardly seemed to
afraid that if he
it might have happened anyway
didn't need it
no one had a more
seemed to relax
no one could remember
only there was no way
he liked it

he knew why

of what he would

obviously he could not

stepping into the

thought it was easier to

a combination of
nothing he could do about it now
no one did anymore except
having said this

something was out of place
nor did it
but they could

do not always
it almost seemed like
that overlooked the

he waited for him to

he tried again
there wasn't enough

focused directly on the
in the end
but when he turned back
by now
sunlight shined through
wanted to see them for himself
he hoped to
he tried to ignore
and like most
echoed through the

according to his book
and carried on
he recalled having read somewhere
what to
just when he was about to

he might not have
when he had the chance
her eyes blinked open
it struck him that he could
when he was halfway

he didn't want to make him feel
picking up

it almost looked like
he had left was all
put the
he had purchased
he doubted he had
the same as his
it was difficult
but there really wasn't

but now he was able to
with a defiant look
no one knew where the
he went on slowly
he was there
no idea
looked at him
so long as
it was almost as if
he arrived at
told him he would
there was no point in
but it was nothing compared to
to do something

but that didn't make him
this could only mean one thing
but was now

his eyes were

he had no idea how he'd

as he usually did

any number of

it was against the odds but
the backbone of
on a collision course
was the only way he could
had sensed the
as he tried to

if he had not been
he didn't want him
than he could have
now it seemed to have
and the idea of
he could hear the
understood that if
was the first time he
as if it could
it would help
was largely
the fact that had
but just then he reached out
whether or not he
strangely enough
took a deep breath and
if he wasn't simply
somewhere along the way
by a was
but nothing happened
part of the OS
the fact that the
was not sure who
until he had
a moment later the
aside from that it seemed
it was better than
at length they came to a
for the next decade
differing only in
with no phone
it would take as much
he didn't know how much
he had hoped
but that evening as
but was
the net effect was
going to be
after several hours
his attention to
he had only to
he tried not
stands on the
but with any luck he would
even for a
never before had he
but now
at last a
then he saw
saw nothing
he was about to leave
on their computer screens
long enough to he
he was trying
why not
or that
and from the
but it was locked
he could see
more limited

that calmed him down
and he could come back
and even if he wasn't
then nodded to the
it had been quite a
it wasn't like he was going to
but he needed the

for whatever reason
then he got it
and didn't look back
for the first time he considered that
off to the side
the front of
not even a little
including a
the first time they had met
but he would be
just to
but he would have
but he had been able to
after just a few
as it was as
did not specify
when he had saved

and twice as
that didn't mean he
lightning cracked
anything would be simpler

but he knew what
which might afford him
feeling that the man had somehow

whether the
when he was younger
he was going to
started to

could do
out with
and since he
he neither expected nor
a man who could
when he knew he didn't
who worked on
for the moment
he couldn't ask for
to see nothing but
but it was not enough
it was up to
didn't know what he had
should look and feel
he'd felt this way before
suddenly came
even if he let
they did almost nothing for the
it would be he
different ways of

he had just arrived
the sense
it was for the
and for a moment
did not make him
for all his
he was about to reply when
the same time he
it was easy for him to
but in reality it was
the man's eyes were fixed on
not just the
intelligence was being stolen and
they didn't want people
while he attempted to
and take his chances
he found himsself
backed away
for a while he was so
that he had taken from
led them to
since he wanted to
in the cold
what he had in mind
had never minded
remembering something
now he'd decided to
at the same moment
he hot-wired the engine
no desire to
but it was much too
and in this manner he was
or more likely
things had
it looked as if it
while wondering if
it looked like a great
and would gain nothing by
and moving toward a
now there was a
make out
after a moment he realized
something else was
he realized how he would look to
look as though
he was wearing a
anywhere in the galaxy
he shrugged, wishing that
so he wouldn't have to
there was none
in return
in favor of an
but that was because
where he could
and discovered that he was
and might actually have been
of an adequate
had time
of course he wasn�t here as a
happened to be
as if from a very
and went back
he hung up
to because he had
he could probably make it
no one else could have
and had the ability to
he tried to think
was coming towards
there was however
the effect was astounding
other end of
and several times he
was no closer to
were not far away
pulled himself up
the only thing that could
is as big as a
for a moment he felt
it was a disgrace
from far away he
and had tried to
looked up at him
the rest should be easy
was odd
he wished he hadn't
looking at each other
the way he'd come
as he looked at them
caught sight
but that left only one
he paused and the
found him too far from
was concerned with
and that he could
a more popular
since there was nothing else to do
some time
he hadn't had
there was little chance
he had almost forgotten about
nothing else would
still it was a bad time to
had betrayed him
but it was more
was a very good
except that it seemed to be
after the past few hours
he looked rather worried
he knew they would be open to it
didn't matter much
there was nothing he could do about
they might as well have
tell him that he
and knew he was
then decided the chances of
the fear overwhelmed him
he had been but
the cards
suddenly they heard a

once in the
and listened to
had never heard
find it
a small part of him was
useless without
that somehow
a split second
going to say to
it was the only way to
felt as if he was
was not what it was supposed to be
though hardly
which seemed to
so he could at least
they had done what they could to
after everyone was
he almost felt like a
and maybe that would be
he tried not to look
promptly forgot what
and he got a look at
security
not so
he realized that there
he arrived at the
more than a little
that would have surely
after this
and for a
and seeming to
it appeared to be
of it was the
which he was
more often
after a few moments he
to him at all
and he could see
the light was
going the extra mile
with a few
and it occcured to him that
the most important thing about
but he never
was going
he thought as little as possible about
didn't have any trouble
bit of
which might be
all things
than he could have known
to have was
if he was right about his
and they announced that
to be didn't
and they would never
walking through
the way he
handed the phone back to
it looked like he
since gone on to
though he didn't know how
in the grand scheme of things
but even that had been nothing like this
was waiting for him
thinking about that
search for you
it came to rest at
showed that this was an
before anyone else
it was suspicious
if it was not
the same changes
each of
he didn't have a

had changed a great deal
was that obvious
try try again
the irony was that
already been
clearly saw the

a better look at
it was not the
of the corner of
morning he
something or another
he pondered this as
got out of
far he had
wanted to see if he could
just like those
the kind of
all the way back to
although he had seen nothing
he was better at
did not like the feel of this place
he had not at first been
felt a bit better
he wanted to be
although there was nothing in sight
then he could
by a
he looked around and saw
reminding him of a
it seemed impossible
much to
it took him several seconds to
not that he had taken the
at least to
back into
the last few
it did not move like
but it was well
up until now
and its full of
while he watched the
did his best not to
there was only one option left
what used to be
he suddenly
no matter how much
he couldn't bare to
was without explanation
were unheard of
turned on the radio scanner
in return for
but something
a momentary glimpse
he knew that
they marched along a
and it brought back memories of
he was a bit
sat down opposite the
he went over to the
was almost too
knowing that he was
must have fixed the
then it began
were led through the
to fight
he did not want to talk about
the computer automatically
he was not quite
whatever it might be
was dimly aware that
probably because the
looking about
he had tried not to
he could he
it was bigger than he thought
shorts out
so that later
was not so sure
marveling at this
since then the
thinking that if he could
make them
but he could barely
nothing else
concealed a darker
so there was
since it never helped to
he should be he
was crowded
was a testament to
but not enough to
but he didn't complain
might be testing him
not to was
if only
but he forced himself to
it was strange to be
were calling him a nut case
this was dangerous and
yet he had not really
in relation to
some of them are
but he didn't go near
with a sigh of relief
as though it was all
he would agree with him
wouldn't let anyone see it
but better that than have his
and few of the
if it existed at all
behind
were said to
see the he could
and to let them inside
that did not matter
where he worked as a
by late morning
until a few minutes ago
but he had known that it would happen
and thought about the
beyond it the
that allowed him to
his weakness was that
he always tried to
which they
examined the room he was in
made everything look
in one was a
while the chances of
in no sense
the way they had
and it was in
if he came across
since it had been

willing it to be

in all cases
perhaps in response to
he had left was
just for
he moved his
therefore this was
at the back of the
the progress of
such a good idea
figured that it was

he wondered if she had finally

before he had been unable
he opened it
that was close to the

so near to his
but was now occupied with
smiling back
the others in the
that he thought that he
and every one was
far larger than he'd ever
according to
neither of them were

knew a whole lot about
but that would hardly be a
that was recently
he was now aware of the
he remembered that
and he walked away from the
no wonder everyone was
he was almost sure that
moving away from the
nearly always
set before him
could not conceal
just ahead of the

can i bring something
he recalled why
first he would check with
he could still
was not to
no matter what the
before too long
like any other
his mind off
might not be well received
he made it to the
no explanation was necessary
he would have been
could be tricky
he had been as
just in case he
superimposed on the
wasn't that
since the first
which he knew was
himself in the
but there were others who
then looked up to
and now he would have to
leaned over the edge of the
he tried to see the
and he saw only
but it still mattered to him
but at the moment
first thing in the morning
he was forced to reconsider
tempting as it was
that he was to
as though he never left
turned away
had put
to expect that
he ignored him and began to
not if he was going to
initially the
some of them
a couple of times
it would be no small
he couldn't imagine anyone
least he had been
felt like he felt like
tried in vain to
that he had seen before
had joined in
that he had no time for

at long last
they reached a

supposed was
he wondered if they knew
and now had
he would no longer
after filling their
to rid himself of it
when it was
getting out
none of it compared to what
wandered out to the
he had to know
he had forgotten how much
it simply never occurred to him
that made him want to
moved out of the way
to say the least
appeared at the
best simply to
could not be in two places at once
for them
not enough to
he was not even certain that there was a
almost everyone he
were going
and he couldn't help but think
as though intended to
wasn't a bad idea
would do what he could to
he chose that moment to
that he might have made a mistake
steals information right out of

there was no more
was doing a good job of
that's what was bothering him
for several long moments before
him look at
he it was
he almost forgot
trying to pinpoint the

there was not a single
watching him
except there wasn't any
one was forced to
he would never see them again
made its way
maybe if he knew that
followed by his
was he was
and wondered if he had
finally settled on the
he would make time to
though she doubted that
turned his attention
was afoot
when someone grabbed him from
he was not
made him uncomfortable
he was impressed with
the direction
looking for other
had once been
until finally the
were asked
but that didn't
into the phone
up with
this was why he never
when he closed his eyes
was about to
it was more than possible
moving ahead of the
into which he had
it had been a long time
so whether he
but the kind that
looked toward the
the trick would be to
he hadn't been home in three years
was well
it would be a miracle if
more than i had
this was something
relentless about it
close enough to
what had been done
managed to look
he had been able to
in a small way
and he knew he must be
he didn't want to give him a reason
learn to
at least all the
he watched him as
but they were expensive
is the way
he reached
outside the
he was glad to see
but now he wondered if
moment later
the grass was still wet
to get a better look at
never made much of a
it seemed that as a
with the need to
grew steadily worse
more like
that he had not already
once he was done
were just
he said to
where he would be
when the pain became too great
they were approaching the
several times he
but it was always
him that there was
something that's kept him more
and they were already
he didn't even know where
they knew about his
would be like
what we need is to
his breath
had to do it
or nothing at all
so he was already
needed to get to
they all knew the risks
there were probably
before they were even
but it was clearly
thought of how he had
each in turn
from one to
to he would have
in the distance he heard something
at the far
few minutes
was obvious
didn't even
they had one of the
was not over yet
at least he wouldn't be
wrong with
came to be known
and only when he
was little more than a
with extra
doesn't hear
finding himself in a
had only just met
them to
his mind was
tracking it down
after the horror of
and then he saw that the
he wondered briefly
he was amazed by how
as if this was
if he wanted
do it but he
the but he was
but there was
to the he went
but simply
see him
he took the next
as if they were
but that wasn't his problem
remembered that
it was very bad
before he realized what he was doing
he knew her ever since
once or twice
he was serious
he had that was
for him to it was
he could already
at some point he
type of
were he found
of that
and then one day
screen was frozen in a
though they hadn't been
by surprise
some things are worse things than
moments later
then there was a
this time it
would be gone
spend a few minuets online and you
he was especially
one and the same
but by now
that could never
it to the
assuming that
it became a bit
it could have been worse
no matter what he had done
and that was what they had
wondered if
as he made his way to the
it took just one
if he were here
could be
made himself believe it was true
didn't really matter
and he would do anything to
he realized that they
from all sides
but he was the first
never the
he always forgot where he kept
he accepted it with
as if it were not really
it was just too
only added to the
and he didn't think to
yet he had been
only to be
wondered why anyone
wondered if anyone would notice
for no reason
he tried ot focus on
since they had
he told him that
had an answer
had gotten out of control
with that the
the distance he
looked up to see
he knew that was
but that would be
on the other side of the
the then he
on the part of
but it didn't help
he wasn't the hero they needed
that there would be no
quite a few people
he had seen one in which
with its
not know how to
meanwhile he would
doubts whatsoever
set out to
after some time he
that way he could
he didn't realize how
sprinted up the
the view from his window
and if
were so obvious
not been able to
most of it
for the most part it was
ways of
now that he
and left you that way until
who was close behind
had never been alone with
though useful for
as though there
thought about it
trying to wrap his head around
they would have
besides it just
could never have
that was in
meant nothing to
he seemed as if he were
left behind
with it constantly
it was just another
remembering this
to begin with
have it
which was no
while the
it was too easy to
will it
but what with the
hiding it from view
kept walking
unsure of what had happened
but several
watched for
it wasn't until
including an
he contemplated the
really cared about
derived from
thus it was that when the
it but he knew
as they moved
he almost didn't
the he walked
given that
what he knew
hadn't seen him since he was
that to the
he realized that only
was only one
he turned to face the
he might understand
and a chill went through him
simply had to be
when he thought of the
anything that might
follows them around to
resumes his slow walk across
he knew who he was and
and in the process
a few years back
but all at once
that they were
but they had no
have to he was
he was not used to the
he had nothing to give
he knew that is meant
didn't know what to say
offered him a
was already on the way
needed to talk
but how did he explain the
or had he merely been
have to do
tried to argue but
because in a few
that he now accepted as
sure that he was
he would decide on
call it that
he remembered that the
was asked
almost like a
was the sound of
it felt good to be
he looked back at the
as soon as he had everything
thing was
seemed no
closed his eyes and saw
knew about
he had so many
in any of the
at the edge of the
without trouble
he felt like it should
any one of
he knew what he should do
and no one talked
and too
experience
had to get serious
just as it
didn't care for
found him
up into the
emerging from behind the
he was too often
for these
in quick succession
closed the program in his screen
if it ever happened
but as he was
in his
it was above all
it didn't seem to bother
it was as good as
struggled to get out of
least he could
course the
it felt like
he recognized them
although he was unable to
it was the most
he stared
but as they
it was probably a
seemed to rise from
they had done
which eventually
expression on his face
they were everywhere
it would be difficult to
get a
but there was nothing he
actually were
even so he seemed a
realized what had just happened
though he hadn't
getting chucked right out of the
it did not matter that the
and the way he
hadn't bothered
care that
he had it was
lost for
it was too
which leaved him with
even while you were
and he had gotten this far
afterward, he prepared the
but they were so
this one wasn't
similar to the one
he returned with
since then he had
on either
so he looked for
looked into
he noticed
a few more
in an instant
this had to
but at his failure to
the only thing that
if it were simply a matter of
made him believe that
then he watched
that had the
all of this was going
than he had believed possible
one of them was going to
without any guilt
this was what he
had already spread to
what he knew what he
this was the realm of
do a
but didn't think it wise
except that
he craned his neck to see
but he could tell by the
but it was almost to much to
only one
because it made sense
none of them knew how to
one moment he was
but within his means
long enough for
vanished in
had a chance
he strongly suspected that
he felt like he was
but maybe it was
which could only be
they had found no new
but he knew he needed to
that had either been

and most importantly
laughed at
a long time since he was
looking through the
were not overly
next to
all he could see was
found a way
when he found him
no more
so usually
is not coming here to network
and went into his
it was too dark for him to see
but that wasn't
one advantage
all he ever would be was
large enough
but perhaps that would
reminded him of
he got through the
sure they
but it was definitely
devoted years to
heard him
he knew that he was not
regardless of the
it began to give way
and the following afternoon he
he should never have decided to
is sometimes called
he watched carefully as
if he had waited
had made him
which meant there would be
them all
because they needed
and stared at the

a fraction of what it was

a curious sense that

that didn't
but just as the
originally from

he knew what he wanted him to
seemed of a different type
to be this

he wasn't sure he believed any of this

and the way was clear
but he was oblivious to

he was tough
but it was hard to
but instead of

it was a puzzle to him
where he had met

he had never looked more
to figure
in the side of the

whenever he tried to
could do was the
when he arrived
but he couldn't say it here
something more was in order
then back to the
as he was acutely aware
he felt like he understood
but even if he was
there hadn't been any

he had never even

this was not going to be

a hundred feet below

that was bad enough

though most of them still
from the opposite direction

it would not be surprising to
was looking very impressed
side by side
didn't look to
on either side
he was waiting for an opportunity to
he had enough sense to
and worst of all
he didn't know if it would
knowing that they were already
behind him was the
the phone rang
even though some of the
one that might not have
and allowed himself
could not be used
preventing him
for another

he felt a

this was the second time he

no doubt having

he didn't really think anyone would

he meant
so strong that
making sure to stay

as he pointed out again
he must have left before
he was fairly sure
but there was nothing strange

it had been a loong time since

coming closer
what bothered him was that
though there was

he wanted a quick

as if searching for a
a step

something was up and it had

but what did it mean for
knowing it meant

so it probably didn't matter
he felt bad for making him
he would have to have
but what good would
was all the way
he didn't realize how difficult
as any he could imagine
to keep from losing his
just to confirm what
which accounted for the

that he did

he looked like he
it was as if he had

he was undercover as a

sure they were
worst of all
he wasn't expecting him to
feel as if
or even worse
surely this was the greatest of
even the way he
it was coming in fast
he would have to wait
was exactly what he

this sort of
approaches the
hadn't done it
toward the distant
all that was left

then walked to the

ever increasing

he finally looked
the best thing about

it was at

even if the

insisted on a

rolled into one

forward and
not help
even though the whole thing was

tonight there were
in an instant he
no one seemed the least bit

no one would believe he was

or at least didn't

he recalled the

he retired from

bringing the cup to his mouth
something occurred to him
it had been a long
ready to be

this was the moment he was

as if he never had

suddenly seemed
if there were more
knocking him into the air
ever since his

it didn't occur to him things might be different
he followed it
it was not the best time to
they went
he didn't know where he would
it didn't occur to him to

as though longing to
walking back
tried to keep his
everyone in
they were just

but it meant he wouldn't

he thought of little else

bad enough
he could do better
like he was not

then he went off to
then he walked back to
but it made him feel
this was when it would be

in a language that
of it was a

anyone who has ever tried to
them away
he probably had a private
back to the he
he didn't know what
in front of him was
was nothing like the
when he had gone
without warning
better than he
it was as if it had just
for her
he couldn't possibly expect him to
when it came to
as it used to be
but his reaction was
a man of his

he tried to keep
made him nervous
had forgotten

daydreamed about the
sure he could not

noises from below
he kept one eye on the
of anything that wasn't

be the last

especially among the
glad that he was
but he hadn't much since
if any of

it was as if
if he didn't have

walked on
he was using the

that would make it easier for
just as did the
if he had any other
a nod
he took another step toward
so much as
the only problem was that
but was not brave enough to
other than
so he decided to have
wondering how he would
he was not afraid
and though he was
before he had never seen

otherwise he would not

as he waited for the

less and less

like he was interested
but in the end it wouldn't matter
reminded of the fact that

who was by now
there weren't many options for

another way
the more likely he was to
but who knows if
a cool
quiet for
the more time that passes
he had assumed

he wondered how he would
what would he
maybe none of them were
he half expected to see
not exactly the

that it was a

took out a

after what he had seen
to whom he owed his

and the depths into which
it would not do much good
but he couldn't because
amid all the

and they headed to the
while they were being

on one of

too often he felt the
but then he realized he didn't
they were at the

he kept telling himself

as he went
to solve this problem

over his shoulder
they were the

as he tried to decide
she watched him as he
hadn't had any
he was relieved
he was not sure he knew
this time it definitely came from

that it was but
if he didn't get a grip on

all they
sat on the edge of the
there were also

this time he made sure to
and whenever he was
was glad he had
didn't make much noise
late in the afternoon he
walked by
the corner of his
while he was
which was nowhere near where he wanted to go
there was no doubt about it
whatever else he
not until the
he finally stood and
he didn't know why the thought
need to be
it was still a relief when he found
these had seemed
getting into the

there had been no

to look as if
there was absolutely
whatever it had been about
or if he just hadn't bothered
he wasn't here to
he took a deep breath and
he walked to the
which meant he was
as if talking to

shook his head in disbelief
the next thing
not only as a

as he pocketed
and even if he did
he had been so
any effort to

and he knew what they were before

also had a

he was expecting the

was enough to let him

took to
he looked at him for a moment
having been
he reached for it but
with no room for

of that was
it was generally
but came up empty
remembered the first time
he'd half expected a
when he was done
wondered what it felt like to
waited as long as he could
what was going on
what he was really
were covered only by
but that was the limit of his
but was not enough
it was his fault that
to he didn't want
and it vanishes
could hardly stand still
because while his
but he saw the far in his eyes
he was looking
he became aware
he had no control over
allowed for more
he felt as though he'd
well maybe it
for the first time and
him that he
he must have suffered a
back up
felt it was
didn't either
he wished he could
he had grown attached to
wondered what was supposed to be
opened the bag
distance he heard
otherwise the room was empty
even if it had
of course it could have been
but he barely had a chance to
but when he was done
it had not occurred to him that
anything further
it did not sound like
many were already
was not over
but it was best to
any of the
or some other
he began to suspect
in its entirety
even if it meant
judging from what he had seen so far
with no one around
but he was also a little
no doubts whatsoever
felt the need to
it was the first time he had ever
to which he dared not
he wouldn't want him to
somewhere behind him
but everyone who had business here
he had learned from him that
and in no time the
he couldn't decide on
was all the same
in the moonlight he could see
and none of them were

shock of
that tears began to well up in his eyes

and he would put nothing past him
somebody was bound to
there were already
in such cases
and considered asking him
what you might call an

so that he could start
would take less than
he didn't want to have
it was difficult to believe it
already taken
was no time
and before he could
it was just one part of
which at first
than he did the
he thought he might be
and he couldn't exactly
or had he been
but now that the
the only words
he had felt the loss himself
turning back to
required them to
was no more than a
he walked past the
he joined them
in search of

and had a habit of
no matter what he
got to his feet
there would be no doubt that
he was not a

but if he didn't do anything at all
until only the
gritted his teeth
might want to
at least it would
he was right about
an absolute necessity
he would rather be
he was less certain how to
apparently he did not have to
much as
a matter of

he could see a slight

it was sure to be
who had dealt with
looking out over the edge
or not

another screen monitored the

almost small enough to

he didn't want to fight them
especially not anything
yet this was no more
knew that he knew that
seemed to come from
as though ready to
taken from
but there were none who
he didn't know what to do about
for some reason he
and he realized how much
told him about the
he braced himself and
all to aware
how he had found it
had come
were nothing more
outside it
walking up ahead
done it with
he finished
he was not sure what
could never
was not the first
until eventually
almost like
he had acknowledged as much
he walked out
but he no longer had a choice
was too cold
was watching
there were so many
might be a
was at
opened his mouth to speak
he would have to and
where most people
away at it ever since
let alone had the
making his way
chance to but he
danger of
always been
held no appeal
he had ever
he had already
which now
turned to the
how was he going to
another one of
it has to
he was here to
the back the
he felt exhausted
which were rather
he had anticipated his next move
climb out of the
enough to let in some
expected
through a
despite the lack of information
the farther he got from
they had to know
no other
there was definitely
he had no doubt the
he didn't want to go back
on an assembly line
he wondered what the
was something he had been trying
and then he thought it might be a
only he didn't know how to
he still tried to
knowing that to
stepped outside
since last listening
he didn't seem to have
it was clear he
but he found now
part of him was
he was so
see it
retired to the
unable to hear him
one that he had to
had to write software to
was because he
knew that he
it paid to have a good
is necessary
spread out around him
he turned on the lights
moment the
and he followed him
had not been as
it was more like
and it was still there
he wondered what would have
he never realized how
he had a more
pulled in closer
he'd never liked the idea of
he had it
who had already been
here and there
he'd been given a chance
something about the way he talked
everything had changed
but he ignored it
flicks a few switches on
as they would have done with
than one of the
he did not know which
sometime after than
want to think about
but if he could
it must have been
the looked around
it was as though the
was the most fun to be had
but at the time
as some of the
were far
when he knew that
liked the way that sounded
sure how many
was closer
was waiting there
swiftly out of the
so he must have
believe in
that wasn't an encouraging thought
door and
that was something he hadn't
so very few of them
no longer on the network
were back on the
which meant he would most likely
that didn't prevent the
after several years
but anyone who tried to
there were still no
set in his ways
turned to see what
after a few
maybe he would
to all the
just to exchange
the only thing keeping
as if it mattered
it somehow
but hoped it might
and all he could do was
weren't used so
it was now
he could never have
he didn't like the way he had looked
the far end
than he was before
still he had to believe that
and were reserved for
everyone expected him to
there is an unfortunate
been the last
knocks on the window
was well on its way to
was not at all
that he seemed to
was worth more than
he blinked
realized what
and there were more
he knew that now
going to he was going
at times he would
but not quite yet
a few minuets past
keep moving
concluded that he
keeping an eye out
sat down beside
but when the
which probably meant
without interference from
was something he was supposed to
but not now
now he had no other option
what was needed
was a total nightmare
told him that
as usual
that will
this is nirvana
maybe he was too
the worst of it
look a little like the
there were no
he couldn't very well
he stopped and looked back
perhaps to keep it for himself
one at
it could be
was nothing but the
was out of
but usually he was
but he seemed otherwise
him a look
enough
no one here now but
he finally calmed down
their best hope was for him to
headed back
he had found the
on the dot
he could always
there is something about
he didn't know what he expected
he let the phone ring while he
but he could think of no better
had seen the
but behind his
than he
he trusted him to
realized the full significance of what he was doing
without any
a moment later he
he hoped no one
long as he
came specifically to
sell his off
he looked out at the
got a lock on
as the rest of the
he was dressed in a
he asked for
because it looked like he had
just in case he got any ideas
he was headed for
and if they would just
is where
could even see all the
held his
but he still didn't
much the same way it did
he was the only one
so obvious that even
was leading the way
for some reason he couldn't stop
to do with the
were only
he was sure
was and in
just a formality
stopped listening to
and then another
so he wouldn't notice
he did not like the idea
and had he been
the day
he though he could no longer
but had never seen anything like this
a couple of guys in
he'd had in years
it was harder to
showed potential
not today
but when he first
of some
and soon they were
had got rather
he wondered why he
it must have
on several of the other
in the distance
was time to get
around and
was all
somehow he knew
how was he
had disappeared
he had wanted to
was completely deserted
that was perhaps
knowing that he had
but he despised
in moments like this
still haunted me
he never bothered to
without hesitation
was more promising than
just what it was
but he didn't want
pleased with
it probably was
there was a certain logic to this
and in many respects
and that he had sufficient reason for
that's what
arrived at the
was all he
on the bench where
the night
had been the first time he had
had done its work
turned to
he knew that there was a
the whole thing was
as long as anyone
he didn't know why that
has taken on
had been the last to
later that night
as long as it
was already on
not so far from
he didn't think much of
that which was
and he now looked
often it was a
and he could almost
seldom came here except for
there was nothing near the
into his
just in time he
around back
couldn't afford to
also giving chase
but never touching
its just getting
would want him to
to reveal something
it had seemed impossible
it was clear he had
already knew what it was
they were at

he sat beside the

since the last
they sat together
he had to see it through
even as
it was hard to know

at first it was not

she was much like

he thought about

how did
there was no easy way to

he imagined
larger than

everything he
there was no opportunity for

tossing it all

and maybe that was
part of him
looking somewhat like

once again he heard the

maybe since he hasn't

before he stopped to catch his breath
there was no way of

that had been a mistake
and lost his nerve
he missed the way

not that he was
the funny thing was that
he realized now that the

turning his attention back to
over to his

it was easy to see
began shaking uncontrollably
the bottom
that opened up back onto
along a dirt road
just the two of them
waiting for the next
he knew exactly how
there was now
he had been tempted to
that it might be something
making his mouth water
if that was what
he worried that one day
at any time since
that required the kind of
not long before
had always been certain that
it worked
he could not be sure
he was satisfied that

acquired all of the
the harder it would be for them to

then he realized
the following
and struggled to
did not know
it sounded like he was
his life on the line
that they called home
had been since he
not for an instant
until it reached its

himself from

he recognized that
for the first time
if it had
what could be wrong
clutching his
and especially no
gone into
had always expected
out from under the
most of them have
would become in an instant
he was already moving
few minuets
he still he
he had been preparing for
it would have been easier to
got their attention
moved quickly through
and he wondered where
he could not afford to
peering over his shoulder
one of many
with more time he would have come to
in much the way he would have
it might have also
while a dozen
a person could conceivably
made sense
stood behind
wondering why he had come here
as if it was perfectly

it was true that he

it didn't matter how
that this situation
could clearly see that
too often
too bad he hadn't brought along a

that would make it
at the end of the street
didn't know if he

to play
he looked down and saw
at least he was still able to
and right now he
as he lay there and
would never get used to
he was afraid he would

the database
he chose to
were needed to
that was when he
couldn't keep doing this
were waiting in the wings
would make it easier
because of
were in the same
sure but he was
turned and
and realized what was
and now he knew that
he was only
it could certainly
whatever he had
leaving him alone
care about he didn't
been with
and the fact that
he knew that it was true
for him to wait any longer
trying to he
but also by the
than was much
but he gave up and
only he had
before he realized that
and then he
from the looks of it
simply because he
but they seemed
before he could think
he needed to say something
he checked
when they had
glanced around the
he could do was
desperately in need of
took this as seriously as
got very nervous before
moved to the window where the
quickly moving
and now it was
now it made him want to
and then he slowly
him look
if there
all the time
just a
it only made him
but not so much that he
but he still remembered what
in fact if he
tried never to do
sweat dripping from his forehead
be more
that he might have been
for any reason
perhaps the only one
perhaps it would
he was in too much pain to
are enhanced
was relieved to see
if anything happened
knew that
but it seemed like
all over again
an escape from
but he didn't see
size of
but he knew it
and thought that he might
know what he was
wanted nothing to do with
had been there
were all about
did not escape
but where could such a
something really happened
could no longer be seen
something about him was
made use
for there is no
it would be much worse
as it were
he turned and hurried into the
making it clear that
the only one to
shaking hands
wondered if she
because there wasn't
cannot possibly
at last in whatever
he was not ready for
but he was genuinely
was provided for him
that was almost too
as quickly as possible
his way toward
was in his late
as he had so many times before
he never had
he kept
the fact
in behind
had nothing to say to that
or just to
but he knew from experience that
had he had
doing his best to
he could not believe
it looked like it was going to
they were only
the past
and they were still
that he had to
maybe he could get some
after awhile he started
he accelerated rapidly
and he wanted to keep it that way
when he thought no one was looking
a long time since
were few
what must
came alive at night
several times he had to
his eyes were set on
and in fact
was going to and he
the same as was
and he liked it still
decided that he might as well
as he walked slowly
didn't want to go
he decided that he wouldn't want to
but now there were no

as though it were

with a wind that ripped trees from
another example of

couldn't hurt
as he expected
he'd been thinking much the same thing himself
no one moved
made no sense to him
that he couldn't get from
it was evening when
but he had trouble
to be it
they never do

it was worse
in the case of

the most important thing here was
he had chosen
it was the only

only recently did it
in the way that only
less of

a way
he had been on some

as if to remind him
at least one
but it could make you
ignored it until he
when he first
followed closely by a

in your

it did seem to
but none of them
and by the end of the
was reminded of
every time
several of these
had he only known
and wondered what
he would have been better off without
it's nothing like the
the air was
thus he had reasoned
this particular time
looks like
in the shade of
he could practically

as if there was
the last to

he hadn't been careful enough
he had this was

it always surprised him
was proud of his

up to see
and he could not allow him to
he moved away from the
it was hard to tell which
back in
sixpence
so he must be
but he didn't get the chance to
emerged from the
and it was actually a nice
he enjoyed it
with over
end of the at
although it was a
if only just
they would quickly be
decided that the whole thing is
even when a

a moment before
he knew that the

but that didn't mean he necessarily

within a short time after
his way to

glanced over the

he couln't help but notice

for just such an emergency

he realized he was
he looked up to see
although not one of the
that is except
election
needed was
as it came closer
but was certain he was
referred to
needed to be
so he had quickly
or what he thought of as
it might mean
could really do that
he had no idea what to do
were not obligated to
once he
it became suddenly obvious
as if it were
that it he
going back would
he could still see the
but he had a lot of
this one would not
knew that it was
but it took

and knew more than a little about
not only was he going to
was at stake now
was harder
than he had was
he might find in
and although he didn't
was that the only
his car was gone
he was sure that he
he knew what came next
a waste of
wondering which is which
in ways he couldn't fully
he looked over his shoulder
that he had warned him about
had put them in a bind
and in
they were going to need
and now there were
he remembered that this was
over at

back when it was

perhaps he could reach them before they

and even if the
but he couldn't help feeling
but he suspected the

he had been intending to
looked like he had
it had seemed so
all around him
to be anything but
right
just in time to see
worst of

and was surprised by

and it was better that
the almost certain
but that was of small
only a matter of
with every other
and he had the feeling that
was no time for
didn't want anyone else
to be there
couldn't be too careful
faster than he had ever
since he had no idea where the
would be an insult
behind it were
but were
that it seemed
all the same he was
but why had the
he looked at her
he could think of
of course the fact that
on the street
they had been waiting
it was typical of
in the first plaace
wasn't really a concern
would have
there was no way around it
would not relent
look back
and how when a
which he did
waited for him to return
home is where the heart is
he found himself wondering if
that he had come to expect
he had known
there was the sound
he might not be able to
he tunrned back and looked at
soon the road began to
if he could find

this one had a

but by then he

noticed it

no one could remember when
occurred to him that
to react
used by other
that was what made it
he wondered how he could ever have
there might have even been
that's what they told him
he was not certain how much of this
as if he had no interest in it
it was the first time he'd seen
if it would
if he hoped to
which was his purpose
there would be nowhere
work for
blinding him for a moment
for him to see
he could not find his way out of the

for the sake of
that he had told him about

there was hardly any

with as little fuss as possible
and after he
an overview of

from behind the
it couldn't be
then he'd know where
so now
and this he
but he would have to
he walked into the
in some
it was loaded with
afraid of what he would find
it was like his very first
he hadn't realized that
that maybe he had
it was the start of something
it happened sometimes
he said nothing else
that he felt like he could

for which the
was harder than it should have
but he would never

apart from the others
but even
but they weren't the sort of
he got out of the car
he had been about to
it if he could
his thoughts
had all
all that he had left was
from a distance, he still saw the

the light was still on
he had been with

he was just grateful that
as long as he had
it had probably been
as he followed the

last thing he
it was going to be a
any of the other things
tried to wrap his head around it
not like the
which was good because
this was in the
shortly after
and although he
it was raining hard
it was easy to
as if he'd suddenly
maybe it was because he
he knew that he must have
actually looks
but he was aware that
he suspected it would be
on which to
sign outside

uploading useless information to
interesting part

but these were the
it looked more like a
front of him
at the time of the

but for a time he had been wholly
wondered why
there was a curious
looking back he
were other
but he sensed
but the fact that he had been
an escape

the occasional
that was for him to do
over the edge
so it was no wonder
it was doubtful he'd be able to
would have to be
he was not sure what to make of

shifting into drive
but there was something
than anything could possibly
and he felt the
like something
and he recognized one of them
he didn't know what most of the
he rushed to the
so that he could be
holding on to
from this
even now
he was hiding something
as though he had forgotten the
but not because
sometimes wondering
had nothing to do
but he noticed that
was no ordinary
there was a time
of all descriptions
just enough
they reminded him of
behind them a
maybe there
everyone one of them
to do with it had
one that was not
realized there was something afoot
it was as clear as
he wanted to do was
it was no less than
thought he
plugged in to
this wasn't going as he planned
if he had understood
but he was right
trying not to

was very
in had been

but he couldn't think of anything else
all the same he could

especially after
knew that it
many times at the
was similar to the one he had seen
swept through the room
obviously he was
but none of them knew how to
he looked around as a
he didn't know what that was

was waiting for
not too far away from
when he was about to

even though he felt like
whether there was any
he couldn't remember how

throughout the
he had heard that
for him to it
coming from inside
if he was caught using
the way in which he had
but unwilling to
what did
besides he knew that whatever
as well have been
within a minute
made no difference
and wondered how he would

had learned to
to the
and he had let her down
as if he wasn't sure
he was not the target
way it was the
was so close
and for the second time he was
he had begun to
he just looked at him
at every turn
all he could think of was that
and it would he knew
he thought it
wonder what the
questions
he stepped forward
be hard
but it was unlikely he would
but then he saw
he didn't know how to
and wander through the
more often than
got off at
listening to himself talk
had no doubts whatsoever
light was
or worse
and he would not have wanted
the first thing he
that would only
this is
something about having
to this day
he didn't understand why
his voice rose to a shout
he hesitated just long enough to
if it worked
even he had to
which was so close to
had never been to one
didn't make a lot of sense
he hit a new low
and sent him away before
or imagined he saw
that's what he
he listened to them argue
later he would try to
enough it was
can't even
if someone
he was almost starting to
he could think of was
came out from behind the

which meant that he
which got him thinking
had disguised the fact that
he wondered briefly if
he was being

but try as he might
now he only had to
and there was something else
took out
he could do
and he'd no idea how to
and there was nothing to do but
who all
the angle
could solve it
the parking lot was deserted
he was convinced

the next morning he awoke to

everything else was just
sometimes he felt like he was
can be dealt with

but it seemed to him that
as he waited for it to

he fell over backwards

as he walked over to the
he realized two things then
had long since

in between

a century after the

more of a challenge than

after a second he
it was not dangerous while
was grateful for

he grit his teeth and
in a way that was
perhaps there was a
gesturing at

a constant basis

just as those
would have destroyed him
from there he should be able to
to be doing
he was not reassured

he was back in
take his eyes off
there was nothing but
seemed not to notice the
until it was time to
it was all right
from across the

he needed to get
it came somehow as a surprise now
far from the public eye
he locked eyes with her
to get to

on the verge
giving nothing away
as if aware that

so much like
why he he didn't

he would get him to

to show that
it had once contained

a few had

he forced himself not to

glad to
a minute later

maybe it was something to do with

as he had been
just as he was
permitted now because
could watch

which indicated that
though it did not

although it couldn't have been
uncertain if he could
it took a long time to

but he remembered that
he would never understand how
finding a

it was some sort of

to get a better

it was enough to keep them from

it looked as if something
and this time it was
he walked into the room
he went into the
and cast a glance back at the
like he didn't
and at last found himself
is in touch with

it's the same way
but so far so good
he could only dream about
the far end of
before he could say any more
although no one had
more than he could
over and over again
was worried that maybe
he didn't even glance at it
while he looked at
anything for you
he felt an almost

or nearly true
he found he was

he looked across the room to where
the secret was apparently to
subject to dispute

was longer this time
neither one could allow the other to
but it wasn't the one he
make them out
and nobody really knew why
he paused for a moment to
but now that he
he looked around and
it came upon him so suddenly
it was not what he was looking for
with the last of

no matter how good it is

he would have to find
looking around at the

once inside he
the day after
yet to
he had ever had
everything he did
it wasn't enough to
like anyone actually

it all depended on the
that made no sense at all
but that would

he could not tell

that's when he realized
he was glad he wouldn't have to

he looked nervous

but he couldn't stop from

faced with the choice of

it would be fatal to let

such things made no difference
forced to
the only evidence that the

he didn't believe it

he imagined that without her it

though in this case
and if he looked at it long enough
he walked back to the

held on to her

the answer to

any and all
now was his chance

that inevitably led to

it didn't make much sense
was greeted by

he was having difficulty
he would do anything
and to his surprise
to ensure that
had not yet
posed another problem
he felt certain he was
squinted his eyes
for a moment
at least it
after a few minuets the
the worst was over
might be able to
turned a deaf ear
no matter what happened
and now found himself with
it might be no more than
didn't provide enough

this was sophisticated
if he was not careful he would

to alert the

his thoughts raced out of control
in all
the cold
he might as

watching someone
not so much because
for while the
and not as well as
made less sound than the wind
the first day was the hardest
they had never met
a little something
yet he had never

a couple
couldn't stop
the fact that it
nothing but the

a few feet away

whatever he was doing
occasionally it
they drove together to the
if anyone
and took
he remembered she was still
any progress he had made so far
knew from
it was a little too early for that
as he walked toward the
with every step he took
but it didn't anymore
just the
was almost
careful not
and if it was possible even more
to there was no
he realized he did
this was exactly
he winced at the
as it became apparent that
filled him with
he could no longer
he must have something to hide
wearing a
that the only

so unlike anything he
of what used to be
so far he
was doing him a favor by
as if they
to small to be a

but meant that it

up at the he
had never appreciated the full force of

where he was going
as he saw what must have been a
but it was surely
it was hard to put it all together
and offered to
even so he hadn't
whatever happened he was
could not be sure how long he had
but he sometimes wondered
had to find
the least he could do was
headed back to
sure what he was not
and he only
seemed to take forever
but was still a
it still was by the look of things
soon they were
but they all agreed
watched him go
out for
taking his time
were just as puzzled as
there is no such thing as
they only had one

no one could

he did not have time for
of on the
harder to
which seemed to him the most
there are things that
there was nothing he could do now
it is a
but he made sure
the ground
watching the slow

was only as

there was blood on his

there he was

but now it
did not seem like
fond memories
so much that he
he considered this for a few
but after a lot of
if such a thing were possible
this was all he
just to be polite
sure that he
it appeared that
he had no use for it now
all he ever wanted was to
by way of
in no way
would be awkward
if he had the
seen the
to go through with
it was so strong that it
for the first time he noticed
then he felt something
because for some reason
seemed to be going
that he was but
on the door
carries data on it
more than he realized
but he didn't want to argue
sometimes too well
he began to
it's almost as though
too many
to go
to what it had been
in order to achieve
that was beginning to be
maybe he was not
no need to
that it
while the others
then he turned to
but he was supposed to
his words were
but there was a catch
before he could speak again
but no one would understand
he came in through the unlocked
no but there
in a moment he had
how but he didn't
but frankly he wasn't sure
in some ways
so he did the next best thing
was startled
he could see him
wasn't just something to
more to
or perhaps the
for no reason he was able to discern
he didn't let
the first time he had
for this was the
then perhaps
motioned for him to
he had never seen a
and while he still was
and in doing so
same time
somehow it
could ever make
and he knew he was not safe yet
or even one of
he suspected that he was
unlike them was
wasn't the most
he'd never been in a
it was hard to see where
then he opened his eyes
have been but he
was aware of that
to look at
then there was the
rising to his feet
from the far side
was already there
down on
reached forward
he wondered what kind of
was trying not to think about
watched the immense
but he didn't seem to notice
least that's what he
but he knew that it
only a few blocks away
first time he had
down a
when he turned
but whatever he had
which was a bad sign
he would love to have
but like the
and listening from time to time
in the corner of the
for a few moments more
but the past couple of
beneath the
he could not make out what
or another
it had always been part of
at first he thought it might
or perhaps it
he had been ready for
got a
clear that
had never seen him again
he stepped aside to
from high above him
pursued it
and now they were
without the intervention of

at least
careful not to trip over the
was all that was all
as though the
tried to make
and when it started

he noted the
especially if he had no way to

it gave him time to focus on
although he had no idea what
once there he
he discovered that there was nothing
was worth it

he opened his eyes again and
he had found a
minimized the window
after a while he
but neither a coward nor a

when he woke up

in fact he hoped he could still

from among them
in silence for a while
that meant he would have
asked himself if
it wasn't even a
any given
was enough to make
he would be the
all of which was
had left was all
with the speed of
and a
he had decided to
which was really a

he watched as
especially with those who didn't have

what he had to do
evidently there could be
all he saw was
in this case
he nodded to one of the

there weren't any others
it was not surprising that
to let it sink in
but he didn't see how
no one else was in the
when each
but that didn't make sense either
he'd always been able to
he could not afford
able to
maybe this was a
to use them for
one moment he had been
there was a serious problem going on
was no use
face was flushed
he didn't want to believe at
on their way out
it wasn't the place
at the same time the
somehow he didn't think
since there was no chance of
in this part of
he stood behind her
that made such
more than he knew
at the thought of all the
and he had been too
then he stared into
returned from
one finds
he was not really sure how to
his momentum
in the distance he saw
to think of he
the other side of
if he could score a
might actually be able to
here to
extended his hand
just when
the matter was far too important to be
was his own fault
as if that was
though that
he wondered if he would ever
to punish him for
once in awhile he would hear them
what he knew must be coming
moved toward the screen
without concern for his
that was never
which helped
was as good as
there was a chance that
but really he couldn't take
at that time
as he took the
not all the
it sound
almost before he realized what
but nothing else
came back suddenly
he had expected
he always waited to
after a while he approached
began to think
he followed the other
not with another
her ever
lived and died
hoping that he had
but there was no way it could
within a
that might be
but maybe he was right about
had come to
it felt as if
didn't know what he was
almost instantly a
when he saw the
to lose
there was enough light to
though big enough for
and then they all could
out of a need
to be he could
to and he had

not going

that was another thing about
but in the end
in fact the
in either aspect

there wasn't a chance
there could be a

from what he took to be

and would probably
breath and he took

to him to

carefully he
and while he hated
a few minutes later
never
now he felt
he always looked forward to seeing
gone very different ways
he could see what it
which meant not
for example
that any
unable to sleep
found that
and wondered
but he needed to get

from one
sometimes if he
like someone
he needed to get away from the
the process
trying to get his thoughts in order
first he thought
now runs the
kinetic energy
on the far side of the room
maybe there was still a way
but had found no suitable
while it was not
would find out
maybe he didn't know
it was important to
but what he said afterward seemed
could make it in
it was too much
to complete the job
all of this was possible in
him but it was
all he wanted to
he recognized them by

but he was back in a couple of

he was going to enjoy
he had to think back to
not as
opening it just enough to

it was as though a
as he continued to
but things change
he got up and
for the time being
he might make it after all
he realized that there was
without looking
it would take awhile
as much as possible
it seems more
he found himself hoping
keeping an eye on the
the next few
but this time there was a
but he was too nervous
but he had planned on taking the
it was no use
at least he
already found himself
but it was long gone
whether he could not
by this time no one believed

the morning
there was never

if he had to
and would do whatever he could to
to make it
to track down
to be anything else

he looked up to see the
had to act quickly
not that he
so everything just
but he still had trouble
he could see that he had

and then he would have to
didn't do a great job
the air smelled like
there was a strange
but he would hate to be
and he had failed to
do something

it had become evident that
brand new

and so long as that
the look
was much nicer than
at first he had

if he had not long since
soon he passed through a

back to the was
not that he had
he didn't really think
just enough to
it's a
maybe he wouldn't this time
he just needed the
one look at the
before going
though it tempted him
he saw the
given that the
if he could make it that far
a mixture of
and even though he was
what resembled the
he couldn't remember ever
how had
even though he just
was beginning
he was certain by the
twisting away
and he didn't want to just
felt like he had
a moment he thought
but it wasn't
whom they are talking to
must have been
when he was sure
although they were the only

he knew that a
and his appetite was
the edge
it was like an
resisting the impulse to

someone managed to

there was no possibility of
he walked out into the
everything was always
it consisted of a
but he knew it was crazy
wouldn't tell them if he was
their approach was to
he was better off
was a lot more dangerous
felt the need
realized for the first time
in her
not too far from
to if he had to
that he didn't want to
he wanted to keep
but he couldn't help
he forgot that he
although quite
was making a mistake
as he smiled
now it was too
but instead a

it had been designed
the purpose of the
a moment more and
he had no idea whether
liked to
but he had assumed that
and was abruptly
then he remembered he
which he could
and then he would be back at
it would have to be the
so far he could see no
back down

among other things
he sensed victory

it was a small comfort
and there was nothing he couldn't
not believe that
more than he had

sometimes he got things wrong
did not quite trust the

the fact that but
the same could be done with

all the way to the

it was time
he had so much
been at the
there is or once was
and he saw that
he could hardly imagine
in contrast to the
and he could see a small
had been found in a
but there were more important things
everyone knew the
was next
even so he took a moment to
waste of time
it wasn't his
some of these even
was sure
would soon it would
just when he had enough
have come to
not after everything he had
indicating the
and then he saw
managed to get
he knew that and
the last of the
just as if he were
and that was just about
and perhaps he had
at such times
he was at a loss

he checked his watch
as a source of

that there was a slight

second only to
no one called him

but no further

very difficult to

which meant he was probably
he insisted that his

there was no longer any need to
he knew his situation was
isn't that
for
as he was the
and both appeared to be
at that moment
if only they
as it had when it had
several of the
aware of he was
coming from all directions
he wouldn't risk that
but if anyone looked closely
did not ask why
doubt that
although he didn't
to his feet
made his head spin
watching the
if he went through with

he didn't know what to do
he was rewarded by a

could find
he would never do that

all the same he made sure to
to call the

a look that
realized by the

he was waiting for him there

he could tell this was
it had been no more than a
maybe they were waiting
even stronger this time
to catch
when he burst into the room
as he seemed to
embrace the
he couldn't stop looking now
he looked at them closely
he wondered if he even
didn't understand any of this
he had to decide what to

it was more than

more about

looking at its

he was in the middle of nowhere
in fact no

to say something he

so much to lose if
he was well aware how
went over everything

steals information
that in and of itself
he was and
someplace to park
toward the as he
that was not a

taking his mind off the
door open
he wondered what would happen to
but now he could
and he started toward the
and that would be very difficult
reminding him
she is the best mom ever
no matter
this was something he would

turning out
which he remembered
were indeed the right

rest
he didn't want to be around for the
but it was not the same
or maybe this was all just
all it
the rest
and after he was
but was too

it became apparent that
with sudden interest
it was difficult to

his face
arranged these on
during his madness

there was nothing he could do

it was no doubt
where he hoped
he had no business
even in so short a time
this would have

the storm had come without notice
he seemed genuinely
but he had not been able to
he wanted to scream
but there was nothing he could think of as
wasn't entirely comfortable
it was as though there had been

he doubted his

for him it was
thing he needed was
he managed to ignore
crept into the

but he didn't believe
like much else in his life
especially since he
he was not exactly sure what
how did he know

something would have to be done

he did not want anyone to notice
that much he knew

suddenly he realized that
he found
it takes forever to
feeling that

this was not one of

made him feel like
this couldn't be

was making it hard to

it almost always
and then he realized
so long as he
began to notice that
although he had
could not help
and he was a good
he stopped trying to
brought up a map of
the whole thing seemed
for he had not informed him of
for so many years
as it seemed at first

he didn't like the fact

he cleared his throat

this was not really far from

it would more than

he looked up at the

while he thought
it took him a few minutes to

he had been avoiding

just before he reached the

in fact now that he thought about it
in any way
in some part
like he did when he was

he didn't want to be

although it was not yet

long way
looked as though he

one and one
inside the room
it was closer to a

as he entered the

might have been able to
he quickly tried to

they both knew
it was remarkably
he was his own worst enemy

it didn't help that
what it was like to
he would have the strength
the only thing he
last of

it took him just a few tries
he remembered what she had said
it was best to

he had no way to

wasn't behind him anymore
for virtually everything

he had never seen anything so
made no difference to the

besides he hadn't seen
he wanted to know how
that had nothing to do with the
knowing he

all circuits are busy
he walked past him without
he spoke

around this time
that was the secret
getting out of

must be doing something
paused long
that looked almost
since then a score of
across from
he had been roused too soon
was overwhelmed by the thought of
but it did seem to make him
but he remained behind
why did it bother him so much
but were determined to
wasn't until
and fired it
his heart was
was where
in an otherwise
as much as he could
he realized that the suggestion was
shouldn't let the
for exactly this reason
into the he
wanted to take

he had realized that
that would have been
doing other things
but it was really a

must have

might be expected

just a piece of software
in the few minutes it took
that nothing mattered at all
it appeared that any

he didn't like

he wished he could explain

was not sure what
that was nonsense

would likely land him in
in the good old days
made it back inside
he moved quickly
was never going to
had to be done carefully
off in the opposite direction
and that there were far more
no one knew exactly
he drew back from the
leering how
that were supposed to be
that information
and he had never seen
and he wouldn't have to
in every
and looked at the
he was grateful for what
the size
and proceeded to the
night came
there were easily
knowing quite a bit about

either way it was
unable to believe that
racing toward him like a
he was at
but he had not actually been

surely he should be in
negated any purpose that he might
he had to accept that
he would have to fight to
there was a large
and waited for the
but that was
but it wasn't for him
it was so strange to see
was moving away from the
but while he looked
could someone have seen
was making a point of it
but he needed more
he found that there was little
evidently there were
it wasn't until he
that meant that
feel like he was
should he decide to
it for a
and if that was true
that this was a

but only almost
watching him look at the
the shock of
did not seem surprised to
but he didn't really
he felt something else
of control
wasn't satisfied with
didn't have time to
unsure of what
might as well
had no idea what was going on
he realized he knew almost noting about
seemed to remember
but after a while
like nothing he had ever seen
and he realized
he was clever
wiped her face
than he thought possible
it was at any rate
it looked as if it just might be possible
but it wasn't much of an
to see if there were any
that he had not even
no one knew
whenever he could
no doubts
it wasn't as
no sooner had his
he actually looked
like almost all the
no one else had managed to

obviously he believed that
and they would have
he did not know what
he hoped that he could
his only other option was a

wasn't what concerned
either side
he might be he
it was something he'd thought about
would use the
back of his mind
had little patience for
if it was not already to late
there was nothing to prevent
many of the
he allowed himself to
is subject to dispute
from out of the
the chance of
would not have happened
he never felt so
new ways
it was not there
would lose any chance of
the he looked up
and it never would
had been nothing but
and he could see immediately that
after he
for no
never to be
and he found himself
besides he might have some

as he ever had
was the only reason he
he glanced around at people
would become even stronger
but questions about
some distance away from
but he didn't want to arouse suspicion
not take
to have found

something told him
control of what was
although it caused no

when he found out
easy enough
plenty of

this was where they
it was a mystery to
most of them were not

without waiting for
the meaning in it was lost

he had finally
even someone who
part of him felt like
broke away from the
but it was another
and which had now become
just as he had
just about
and had neither the
who was standing by
no one was there
looking to escape from
he turned to see
this time it was an

and leaving him
maybe even
went on
led to
but even so he felt his
now as a
and incidentally the
at least in some
end at the
been there
real bad
it was theoretically a
genuinely believed he would
it was just but
must we be
he didn't want to admit it
ready to explode
wasn't sure
when he saw what
precisely with the
and odd as it was
in a moment a
was alone with
these few
had already done everything
in the late morning
led them through the crowd
and for the first time in
a long time ago
lost in these thoughts
what he meant
he had never been so
knew it was
it away
it was the best
could they have mistakenly
but everyone knew that
like to
they made him want to
why none of the
and at
but he was not as
had been obliged to
no one would think of
it became
the full
then a number of other
could have
like he was trying to
emphasized by his
sprang to it
something worse than
would be what
of the that was
in a few
to the he
it was almost total
as well as he did
quite a
was exactly the same as
at the he was
as he did when he was
he reasoned that he was
and thus
he didn't know why he
which he seemed to remember were
but he couldn't seem to
could use that instead
he reached inside of the
into the shadows
only in their dreams
to one side
shaking his fist
climbed down to the
fought to
he wondered what he was
but there was only a
but nothing beyond that
had expected
nothing like
on the edge
and had to keep
where the sound had come from
but he was not eager for
as he got closer to
arouse suspicion
but he couldn't let
he wondered if
as would have been the case with
glancing around
he moved
he figured he'd better
while he was still
didn't look back
wondered how he knew that
designed for the
it felt like it had been
it was after all
an example of
it had happened before
up from his

as a part of

too far
knew there
he couldn't help but notice
the process of

didn't seem to have any effect
was like to
the moment that
stayed that way
he started walking
standing next to
whether he knew it or not
he turned to her and
high above them
he tried to look past
at first like a
look at
he seemed to have better
and nobody could expect him to
not because he was at all
it could be interesting
didn't care for it much
so he could get a better
though this might have easily been
was in enough trouble already
had accepted the fact that
out of thin air
took them
now if he could
the and he could
sometime after this
at first there were only
out to find
the writing was in

thought to
if he told him the truth about
when he reached

at this point he just
is due to
if that were
which is the way he
he would never forget that
no big deal
clearly hadn't
it wasn't that
in front of him was a
even the slightest bit
a chance of getting
he remembered this from somewhere
preferring instead to
he had to find out what
but even when
although he
dawned on him
wired into
like he did after
he was grateful for
and far more
in the way
and it was hard to imagine
but this was no
was getting too
he would hate it if
they were in the
was too perfect
soon it would be
for what that was worth
and he did not want to
in the entire
a system of
looking directly
who took things seriously
it was an
he made his way toward the
with whatever could be
he couldn't
to the and
she found him in the
and would not be able to
and went with him into the
remembered the combination
farther out into the darkness
felt the same
the that was
had gone out of control
he turned and saw
that had been no
he didn't want to have this
he went
as a
he was in no mood to be
post of the people here
but he knew this was
he could hardly see the
that made it impossible not to
hated him for it
would have gone
the game was up
shoved open the
he was tempted to
when he was done with
closed the door behind him
if he went back to
it was as if they were almost
there is something
and then he was being
if he began to
did not stay to watch the
the feel
to figure out how he
already fresh in his mind
was one of those
he would but
that he would rather
and he could see that
then breathed a sigh of relief
first there was
that first year when he
hoped it wasn't something like that
this is how
to find him again
then he realized that the
since he had last seen her
all of these
until there was nothing left
software development
had a tough life
changed it to an
and when he realized
had to get away
every time it
made off with the
find them
but since there were
would be far enough away
he'd seen this man before
but he was fascinated by
out of the he
had wasted his time
had probably
he had a chance
someone had to
if it was so
anything to
he walked
and not wanting any trouble
for now
he tried not to move
he was glad they didn't
milling around
and of course he had not
turned back to the
trying not to be
not only could
and then as carefully as he could
although he still had
and suddenly he wasn't
and had been too
unable to connect to
which meant he had missed something
out into
he knew that was enough
he was not sure if this was
if they're careful
things had started to
he took out a
and still he did not
as he waled toward
he considered the possibility that
it was nearly
he would have liked it to be
could be taken as
because what he'd seen
thought
he didn't care
which did more to
wanted to know if
to determine whether
same as
although he could not
but not one
but never so close as this
along with a number of
is intended to
although they could just as easily be
from behind him
especially when he considered
and he couldn't focus on
had a
he actually stopped long enough to
the sky was still dark
out how
were exactly what
seemed to have
must be
so long as it was his own
as though he didn't like
he tried to tell him that
this one
there were a few more
not bothering to stop
so it was
it's all in the
even if he was not
there could be only one
hear
tell the
he did everything
there must have been
he pushed through the crowd
and when he finally
as it so often did
and now he had to pay
was one thing
leaned against a
but they hadn't yet
seemed even more peculiar
although he had not yet
the man was hardly
because that's what
and he had no
so he didn't know what to expect
was wrong with him
the course
last thing
been a had
end of at
with enough
the door to
could be lurking somewhere
by one of the
all the details
hadn't said a word in
that others don't
and he felt like
they were and
he was almost certain that
see that there
he knew it was a
maybe there was
was still in
made it sound like there was
according to the
ever since the
often enough
a change in the
as he took
and they established
and that is through
but no one else
he knew he hadn't
since neither he nor
all he could hear
and even still
his expression changed when
they wouldn't
found its way
as if that would make
in point of fact he hadn't
he wondered vaguely why the
they only
hadn't brought them any closer
he thought a lot about that
at the same
without looking at him
in time for him to
once he caught him
looked in
many times
that much was
that but then he
probably didn't either
but neither did the
others were
although he thought that was
and after a moment or two
there was always the chance
and walked swiftly to the
he had the same
he stopped and
while it lasted
figuring out
as carefully as he could
got out of his
he was almost positive the
that meant he was
from where he had
but it didn't do much good
more there was
because normally the
he had also
he was not entirely sure
back on
had been driven out by
he had that
before anyone could
was wearing a
and he could not
was what made it
it would have been marginally
he glanced at
as though he was the only one
not that he would admit it to
he sat next to him
from outside
sometimes he wondered whether
the challenge now was to
after a short
there was a way he could

he looked around the
the computer was interpreting the
he remembered the first time
he couldn't even recall how
had to be very careful
he looked at him and
he took one last look at
looking her over
and together they
had never liked him much
and so on until
while he might

although he didn't know if the

followed by the
each of the

he remembered what
the time was
the computer came to life
or were they just

asking for it
actually it was obvious

it was all he knew of
his eyes on the screen
he began

the reality was that
he didn't doubt that he would

he would have to hide
for fear of what he would

spent too much time
from where he stood

he was now
when he finds out what he did

when it finally stopped

he heard a faint sound outside his

the trouble was he
had passed on
not even the

some distance from any
or merely denied he had

if not all
if he never found them
watching him look at
looking about him as
he should be

when this had been
moved swiftly down
understood what
to avoid any additional

between these two
and so did the others
of course it did nothing
he was suddenly
but right now he was merely
he looked at each

he was not prepared for a

no effort had been made to

how long
assuming that such an

there was nothing here that
and it was already too late
that would have to
starting in the early
he kept trying to
if he could help it
but he had learned to
the he tried
when he glanced back
the most noticeable was a
few of
found it to be surprisingly
for some were
he was right and
he had learned the tricks
used his
care for
that seemed
their roots
the entrance
he had never seen him
this was the first time
when finally he
until they
and one was
he wouldn't have as much
of him wanted to
he'd imagined himself
it was as if he
maybe it would be better to
through the city
as he looked
would not be
and he was beginning to
he watches as
and for a moment the
had never had
several others
he asked

so that was what
his side
exhausted by
and then looked
out to the
he stepped forward and
the time it
and everyone would
must have had
and reached the
had never struck him until now
the sort of
it as he
and now he could see a
not sure what he was
ever since
the interior of the
to reveal the
real problem
and it became harder to
and he understood why he was
what was going
he had not choice but to
but then he was
he had once had a
up from
he didn't mean to
but most of it had been
looking out through the
exactly what he expected
was a great
if he would like to
and some increased energy
did not have a
had to think about that for a moment
turning around he

it was the first time he
it was as much of a

that the and the
it was a shame that
but that was too
thought he would take it as a
opened the door into
home with him
and found that
many of them had
just hard enough to
he had to be
tend to
that the but he
it was meant to be
chills ran down his spine
but the idea of
he made a point of
by which the
wondered if he would ever
to make it clear that
wherever he could
he could not see how
went without saying
if anyone so much as
would keep him quiet
couldn't believe
he started to remember
home to
but he didn't want to
maybe he could
where he was he
of one of
him about
and he'd rather not
he might even believe it
there was something about that
from all of those
what he really needed was
if the situation did not improve
across the street
the idea was to
it was obvious
there had
but he wasn't interested in
he seemed much relieved to
and he couldn't help but
and it was
he was about to ask him
that would account for
and it was pretty
cool breeze
overflowing dumpsters
could not bear the prospect of
when he saw it was
point of
a way to

it was with considerable
wearing a black suit, and smoking a
on the verge of
sense when
insisted that he
must have finally
the place was like a

most important
worse than it was
climbed on the roof of

he have
especially not the
the door to the room was stuck
and if he was right
but that was impossible
he must have been there
he prepared to
the idea was so
nothing was making any sense any more
had only been
an example of this would be
but he didn't know it was
no one else could see
it came
several feet away from
that led to a
time was running out
the last time he saw him
but a small part of him
and sent him flying backward
would be binding as long as he
was happening so fast
he often thought
or because he didn't
there had been too many

while the computer watched
he thought he would have to
brilliant colored strobe lights
and eventually decided that
in nearly every
was he didn't know what
since he'd gone back to
did not occur to
and he was afraid to
but not at all like the
and then he found himself wondering
could do something about it
talk about
by then the
but he couldn't see
but if that was
there was no telling
he had he knew
most of the people
that guy
he hadn't expected it to

did not relent
but couldn't make up his mind whether

the best chance he had of
feeling the occasional

as if in a dream
and most were
with all
but the idea that
vibrates for

he wouldn't be hanging around when
felt like he felt
felt certain he would never have to
for it to have any
at first he thought he had
didn't need it anyway
he found that
than the
he had always been
what it meant
seemed to be operating
walked out of
but again he was
he had taken a risk by
but long ago
while it had
was some kind of
he thought
never again
especially since the
seemed to find

it was no longer
but then he would be
to it was impossible to
and saw it in the
he had been worried about what
and they were heading directly for it
long time to
to be that
like the engine of a
quickly turned to
headed back into
nobody could change that much
and a few other
was more to
and range from
and had been the
the prospect of
let his imagination
absorbed much of the
and what he must
to get rid of the
it was no easy thing
research into
if he wasn't just
someone who was
he drove away from where
than a
the slightest mistake would be
was fine with that
and he wondered if this was
it only
here at least
and even a
he didn't know if that was
more than a dozen
he had seen to that
held it for a moment
the building
he had to stay
not much
he became certain that
that began at
he failed to notice that
there was a lot
at least not compared to
finding the source of
why would it even
he looked up from the
which could be taken as a sign of
he didn't know what he would do
now had
he got the feeling that
but he wished he would
wasn't here to see it
which would
but there was no guarantee
but now understood what
none could
he should just
like he was going to
he was still not

he knew more
when it did
more alert than he had been
which hardly
the reality of
that had been the

the circuitry was badly damaged

he thought of them
this was called
from there he
and there were several more

down the stairs
and for some reason the
he was there with another man
for what seemed like
but unlike the
as if he couldn't quite
he knew exactly what
although he doubted that
that had never occurred to him
but the chances were
so this was the
even if he wasn't particularly
he saw that
could still
he couldn't think straight
in the parking
he had not meant to
if he could not

he was afraid it would

like the feel of

he emerged on the other side
away from the

but why
had nothing better to do than
moved by the
than he thought
it wouldn't have mattered
he was enjoying himself
and for the time being
wasn't allowed into
so if it had
there was something almost
it looked as though
it was the fact that
leaned back against the
he would just
locked the door behind him
not much else
any other
now he could see the
they all look like
then sat down on the
this was too
control the information
swung open
like something in a movie
went to such a place
approached from one side
he would have enough
leaned in to get a closer look
for the most part
and that the rest was
he could but
but his purpose was to
he was not even
but he couldn't tell where the
even when it seemed useless
and all had eventually
across which a
went against everything he'd
as fast
had somehow turned against him
had decided that the
it wasn't the first time

for the first time he
and another reason why he was
he had been certain that
half expecting the

had a right to be
assuming it was
one and the

when even the
meant that
he had just recently
heading to the
in the back of
whatever it was that
as seemed likely now
he paused to look at
he thought he heard
and that meant only one thing
if he didn't
but he would not
could hear anything over
it was done with expert
but he wondered what the point
felt like telling him
and sometimes during the
but not before
now he realized it was more like a
there were even
a few feet away from
not on an
and the mere fact that the
he needed time to think
almost all of the
he was strong enough to
that he could see
by the time
he had a good
he came to the
he thought it might
and certainly wouldn't have
insisting that
but somehow he didn't think it was
he didn't want to hear
behind him a
something he had lost
any of them
and now it was gone
there at the far edge of the
he didn't concern himself with
he couldn't believe he'd done that
he wanted to get this over with
now he just needed to
hurt to
and it was all
then he thought of
the last time he had
consisting of
this is not what he wanted to hear
when he returned
would revert to
to compare it to the
not so much because of

than he had
could she trick him into
at first he didn't see
too long for any
the same one that
and slowly inched his way
which is why he was not
use the network to
within these were
at her
had been thrown away
that would leave him entirely
as if to prove
it took a few moments for
it was the first time
what
grabbed hold of him
that reminded him
in this particular
flashing a high frequency light
that he belonged to
and he turned around
knocked on the
but he felt he was
he hadn't done it yet
to see it
he already felt as if
searching for a sign of
both were
this might be there last
it seemed to him
spent the next few days
his favorite
for an instant
to give
he also wondered whether
of in the
he didn't want to know
before they could find
starting to he was
beside him
he remembered what he
after several minuets of
or for that matter
as he made his way toward
no fewer than
stepped down from the
this was probably the
were nothing more than
this was the first time he
was one of the only places where
even though he was sure there was
kept people at a distance
but it only
so he didn't need it
but to him it was
he couldn't pretend that
and something told him
although he saw it
so he would settle
and now he was in the process of
there had been no chance of
first is a
but then he heard the
would mean
so that it
he doubted he would
more than likely
and he was so
had chosen
would actually be
but he couldn't stop
as an equal
that despite the efforts of
stepped down off the
he had been expecting a
for the prospect of having
while it remained
if he'd been a
after a moment's pause
or that it had been
to go through with it
he tried to decide which
was going to have to
he didn't think he was
it was the closest thing to
he did not
no matter how he
he was beginning to wonder
by the
he walked through
another detail
eventually he found a
wondering if he'd ever
this time he would
it seemed odd to him that
be much
seemed not to know anything about
even if it was just

every moment he grew a little more
problem was
with the hope that
where there
but it was not a
and so the
just as in the
and even if most people had
a potential source of
he could see where
he wanted to reach out and
used to he was
there were plenty of nice
was child's play compared to
he strained to see
as an
rifles it for
who were far more
what would happen when he
see that he
what looked like a
it must have been an

within reach
he was literally
all of those
worst of it
a faint

he came to a

those people who
was just beyond

probably because he just
he could there was
he knew it
where he saw

recognizing it
noticed it was
when he first approached

but then he noticed that
this was the very essence of
if there had been any
he had no intention of
would believe
interested in
although there
all right
he never expected to know
but he didn't answer
he then went into
the sound
although he was far from
and too much depended on
the resemblance was
the same as
it sounded
he must have done something
to if he had
he realized he couldn't
it must be
carrying some
but it was nonetheless
did not miss
didn't bother to
any better than he did
he waited until the
also there was
he stood for a moment
to make him
and walked quickly back to
a long time
even if he had been
that and he
in one of
this time he
nothing he could do about that now
all around
merge and flow into
was startled to
was now transpiring
who had never
caught his attention
the thought of
and felt like it might
but all that was
was shocked at the
he knew he had
perhaps is reputation had
the day after that
now if he had to
the door slammed
what he knew what
when he would have more time
as he watched as
in a few moments he had
everyone in the parking lot
was relieved
from behind
he spotted at least
how he
not without a
where he lacked the

he was finally
with a look of panic
he must not have
the verge of

either way they wouldn't

since then there
what he had actually done

way of
to get away from

no one cared about the
felt not the slightest
in the past
there was still
he wanted to let go
had never seen it before
you didn't often get
told him he was
which takes you to
he imagined them
sure that
just in case he did manage to
they had everything
recognized the
not that he minded
had no idea where he was
of what he realized was
he picked up the
knocked on
he was looking for
would not think about
to so it was
staring for a second
for even an instant
sat quietly
it was getting harder to
never before had such a thing been
that had seen better days
what was supposed
standing in
he found it just behind
it didn't occur to him that
but he wouldn't know what
which he could use to
what would have happened
watching him as he programmed
all sorts of things
trying to understand
he'd slept in the
only way to

while he didn't relish being

the only thing he knew was that

kept going as if

he had a couple of seconds at most

it was as if someone had
he just wanted to

and again
no one else
with whom he had been
had come to accept the fact that
but as if
there was no way to find out
the situation looked more
for he had been
that clearly had been

forgot that he was

he'd done that a lot as a

the whole point of

there was always something

he shook his head and
for hours
but he was sure
and there was a

at last after
when he was a

it all made sense to him
deep down he
where he would

there could be no

now he was back to
it was easier for him to
does not believe that
although he hoped to
but there had been no

unless of course it wasn't
so it was his turn to
as far as he could see
or was there some
there was yet another

someone would

large enough to support

but if anything he had

then realized that this would probably
so far it hadn't
and so when he arrived
trying to figure out what
but he wondered if
wasn't worth
worked in
he knew he was not allowed to
he was already having doubts that
forward to
he didn't know where the
that was partially
not as much
as much as he wanted
little to
for awhile he had been
it was entirely possible

this was the first
but the idea that someone
was not much
stood at the edge of the
into one of those old
he didn't know him
once he was finished
had been taken from
so he hadn't been
the whole concept of

he almost forgot what happened to
now he saw that
all of this was turning out
he would leave when it was time
or he would have to
it was one thing to
changed everything
needed him
it before
with such force that
he didn't care to
he came to
such as it was
it shared a
he watched as the last
still showed a
in which to rest
trying to figure out the
about to be
someone with whom he could

but was not just
he could not be quite sure
he had chosen an
listened for the

he had gotten used to
and now that the
up on
he was the one
almost as if he felt
there was nothing he
at once more lovely and more terrible
had to make a decision
in either

back when he
and insisted that
as a sign of

pressed a
so that the
then he remembered something
the they were
to make up for lost time
maybe he could make it somehow
it struck home with him
and then had
no one knew how to
there was no proof
out to
how had this
at least that
none of that had been
and now it was too late
in his conception he was not
because he didn't want to
if there really was a

made it hard to

felt as
had never been used before
then he began to
and felt the urge to
at the start
he had the feeling that it would
places like
and it was within
he didn't need it anymore
he closed the door behind him
and he felt like an
one he
now was one of the
and then he thought he
but he decided to
he locked eyes with
wasn't sure how
he almost forgot about
making sure he could
consider themselves

and waited

enough time had passed
had it been known to
since there
that took into account
with her
partially obscuring
he could have anything he wanted
he arrived with
was easy
did it
this was a trap
didn't think that much of the
were waiting to see the
he saw that it was not there
and he did not seem to be aware of
and was trying to
until the
seen him before
quickly checked his appearance in
he had not yet seen
chasing him into the
was disturbing as well
not even a
and its
because otherwise he
he forgot that
his voice
see what it
it wouldn't be
put to use
there was no way for
while he struggled to his feet
he sat down beside
more than once he
especially if he wanted to
and then they
this meant that
looked ready to
avoided looking at
the perfect
what it meant to
he had had experience with
just the opposite of what
took several steps
turning on
he began to think more clearly
as though this were all there was
that hardly mattered
at least he was
trying to keep from
behind him stood a
it was amazing how
slammed into the
going into
had taken too much out of him
his next task was to
then he had an exciting thought
counted on
the two of them
he'd probably never know
following close behind
some ways
it had all come apart
had been there to
except for the
suddenly realized that
there will be
only as
drifted through his mind
now when he had almost gotten
strictly speaking
gone quite mad
the chance of being seen
wasn't trying to
but that hadn't happened so far
but he was the one
he probably shouldn't
he wondered briefly if the
were bound to
nothing came of the
either that or he was
and the only reason that
the man carefully
didn't know what to
he paused long enough to
but really he was
it was like a
wasn't at all like the
he planned to
had never seemed
feels like
as if anyone knew what
that reminded him a little of
will never be more than a
as he did that he
little of all this of course
far as he could see
think of
this required a

worse than it
had better prepare for

it looked like every other

as if it were important to

there was a long silence
he had never before
so he couldn't see it

he wasn't entirely
far exceeded by
great deal of

but he doubted his

went back the way they came
next
rose from the
and the same
before he had to stop
there were some who
among most
knew a great deal about
he had grown used to
from time to time
it was hard to deny
recognizing immediately
but for some reason
but he couldn't seem to focus on anything else
the assumption had always been
he could see he
that they are
but then he
stopped him
and just moments before
was the least he could do
along with any
even to him
the rest of the
every muscle ached from
was starting to get to
he did it without thinking
or even look at for very long
finally the
he was about as
he was glaring at
he looked around suspiciously
the first place
was so much more than
he was looking at her

that didn't stop him from

this was why
his mind has

preventing him from

nothing more than

he was certain of
he didn't stop to wonder
in a matter of seconds
he never understood why

ridiculous as it was

he hadn't thought about it before
but the only one he

the others gave him their attention

to see the end of it

it was a
nothing that had happened
he asked himself

that was the only thing
that it had been

stopped abruptly
for instance
either way it
he seemed tense
the last time he did this
and as far as he knew
than ever before
yet as he walked
making it
let alone the
he needed answers
he should have kissed her
a lot of the time
instead he had
he just had to make sure
there simply was not enough
because they were not

while the other two

he looked back and saw
no it was gone

but first he had to
he was about to ask what
anything about

making eye contact with him
it occurred to him he needed

it was in this
no one else had
pulled something from his pocket
listening to the low pitched rumble
there was only one thing that
to spend
the main thing
more like a
happened time and again
it had started off fine
it seemed as if it was
is far too
not far away
so he reached for
to notice
could see that he
he wouldn't risk
not enough
shook his head and
gone on to
yesterday he might have found that
but at this point
on the other side of a little
was sitting
parked behind the
argue that
no sooner had he done that than
if he did he was sure
with almost as little
felt that he was
he wasn't going to let
but it was very
he would be but
for that much
and the fact that it was
to let them
but he knew he was
in a sort of
have been able to
always meets in a
he didn't agree with
that didn't make him any less
but that was a part of
he stared about him
as he as
alone with
as it had been before
had proven disastrous
still what he had just
if he was going to
was seated on
had all of
reading his mind
then just before the
that they seemed like
he kept thinking as
was nervous and excited
seemed to know
if he didn't kill himself
he had no idea where to look for
at the same time he
some of the
and there was still the
looked into the
maybe if he could have
into the fire
he had hoped it would
just off the
could have easily
ran away, in terror
were talking about
had come and gone
any time
not sure what else to do
could not be denied
when she had brought him the
had not given
was enough for him to
he hoped no one would notice him
a few moments later it was
but he couldn't risk
he didn't want to tell him that
was looking
to assure him that
was getting
it had to remain
which caused him to
the room
him of
if he had been
he was not yet
and would soon feel
he left him and began
could do was
after a
immediately there were
that had been the thing he had
he stood absolutely still
either that or the
that could only be
and were now
though he couldn't help but
it turned out to be a
and it was all he could
in and
maybe if he
in another
and while it wasn't
he couldn't tell what
make sense
rooted around in
could take him anywhere
and gave no indication that
as though waiting for
that it was he
that he now
he knew this was the wrong time
he did not understand how
after many pleasant
the same thing happened
in the morning he
made him feel like he could be
had some
the had been
had nothing
through the rest of
and weren't likely to
was it really just an
he realized this was
had he done the right thing
so he would be
see the
even for that
instead of whatever
he had he knew a great deal in common with
do with it had
he was seriously considering
when he got to the
he couldn't tell if
him now
but he could only feel his
as much of it as possible
and made his way up to the
and he could hardly
to do
all had the
still watching through the
of which was
his first
there could be another
by most standards
the trouble was he didn't really
anymore than he could
both of them
would have something to talk about
which was conveniently
but maybe it was just
it was probably still
so he would have
there will
except that this was
on the one hand
along the
be able
so far it was
it felt as if he'd
which he suspected was
hand clenches into a fist
but it didn't matter
wished he had
but how
not for long anyway
but decided not to mention that
he was probably
and while he should have been
even so much as
none of this was
he gave him a look of
searching for any sign of
reason he had
he was caught by the
yet there was no sign of
everything that was going on
did not move
that was but
had the ability to
it was stronger than before
so it wouldn't
that's where he had to go
and went on down the
for a moment he wanted to
he had to think of a way
it only took him a
he couldn't help but wonder
true to his nature
in a
the first of
he walked to
promised to
they acted like
had made it clear
and then he was
it had happened before to
there was no obvious
in the parking lot
was someone else
it was no wonder that
for one
could not reach the
it provided excellent
there were those who said
its way
by early evening
bur to actually be
though to
before he could stop himself
which seemed more like a
any were
in his face
mind off
he had never been allowed to
had not been concluded
because it hurt to watch her
hoping he was
compounded by another
now there
the latch clicked shut
and several
if he had gotten away with it
it was behind a
the reasoning made sense
but after that
but by then he was
had he been
but it wasn't his
but he would not let go
that looked
it would be easy
looked away
and also
had to he had
used by a
it had been a mistake to
looked around the room
near one end
for a little
down at
then went
at least that was
but he must have
for a long time he just
and now he was also beginning
he was as much a
was less a
didn't make him feel
he was too
couldn't make
the same one he saw when
he could not be sure whether
but no more so than
he sprinted down the
without having to
but didn't want him to be
could imagine
he was just doing his job
he took off his
by day he
he couldn't explain how
continue talking
it had seemed like the
didn't think he would
as large as a
as he made his way
was only the beginning
stood at the shore
but it was difficult to imagine
it was impossible
that no
wondered if maybe
he started the engine
but it didn't mean he
as he went into
a certain amount of guess work
in the meantime
there was a
with his wits still about him
was worse than before
around a
he knew him all right
hadn't anticipated this
he glanced at the
but moments later
he tried to remember how to
perhaps what he'd been doing had
were typically the
he had to assume
whether he
in the depths of his
this very
to then he went
to he had not
it was all he could do not to
had been clarified
not while he was
who he was not
but now he needed to
a reason to
this could be the just opportunity
the thing was
maybe he was already
even then it had to be done appropriately
as if from the
he should have said something
he didn't know just how far
but now it was different
vary from
all of them had
as he neared the
much more than those
which was very
time of
especially considering
realized it might be the last
and it looked as though
and looked as if it hadn't been
his first impression was that
driven into the ground
there was a beautiful
but he was surprised by how
as if something were
he wondered whether
was in contact with
no one else was
a while he
worth it
were seldom
could see the he
in favor of
himself to
once he was gone
was occupying his attention
there would be more
the sky was
wormed his way
not that it would stop him from

because he did not know what
computer generated images
just turned up at the
and only he knew
was time to
only add to the
he should have known
went through
he sat down next to him
he felt oddly calm as he
if this was a
unless they could
but every so often
not so much as
he started to protest
would be well into the
he ignored him and instead
it was the same
he had endured the
maybe they had thought
as was the rest of the
and at the moment
that caught him by surprise
but no one had yet
was cut off from
he could faintly hear the
to be but
from what he could see
except that it was
had recently been
had achieved a
this was ridiculous
even though he didn't
them out
even as he was
or more precisely
was aware
maybe because he was
but then there were a lot of things
the he knew
as he did at this moment
and it was soon
have been he might
he was taken aback once again
even for minuet
had no effect on him
somehow it made a difference that
even without the
he wasn't going to
all the more
is the best
looked into it
as a precaution
have had to
struggling to
leaving something more
more terrifying than before
he was sure that
was he going to
nevertheless he would have to
and looked as though he had
to indicate that
he was astonished to see
assume that

the reason for the

after his

he had been obliged to
sticking out of the

throughout most of
suddenly confronted with

to figure out
that meant somebody had
and didn't move
to be resolved in

he made his way
he had to be very careful to
could not make sense out of
there was no danger of
he still had a
if in fact that was what
it occured to him that
though he was still
this was not a
turned and saw
looked around the room at the
from what he was used to
he had not come this far to
find a
calm and unhurried
in the same direction
moving from one to the next
he was going to and
he resembled more the
he felt like it had been
would plunge into
perhaps that was the
feel of this
followed him to the
it was little more than a
was worried
and partly because he was
he was not certain that he wanted to
which had turned
if it could be said to
any other day he would have
his first impulse was to
and did it again
nothing was preventing
but he guessed
perhaps he was
he barely had time to
he stood in the middle of
and to either side of him
the thing
there had to
there was something up ahead that might even be
was better than his
and any others who
there's more to it than
just for a second
must have been like
which he refused
and then he found him
and this was something he dreaded to
but there were
didn't believe in
because he was on their
he knew this intellectually
and he had to make sure he
how long had it been since
he looked over
and where
he didn't seem to care about
he was to see
he already
but instead it
and it stood like a
had been wise t
reached across to
a look
who had been
that he forgot
thinking about this
what looked to be
from the outside it looked to be
he did not mean to
as if it were from

there was no way he was
then and there he swore to

to leave the

it was difficult for him to

it was the only place he could
and led them to a
after each of them
is open to question
the heat of
he had been doing
everyone else
he stared at
but he saw only the
but one thing had been made plain
he stopped trying to be
could see him
the door slammed shut
it was hard to
if he had any idea why
but one he could live with
for the moment not caring for
wasn't turning out quite as he
with another quick
he was torn between
flickering and disappearing
as soon as it
he was reminded
blink of an eye
spent the rest of
he was not sure if
and he couldn't afford to
was lucky to get any
the back
were not the
him have
until he could see
not just now but
a moment passed
he wondered whether there was
next to the
which relaxed him a little
now they were
it had seemed so real
did very well
taking steps to
enabled him to
as had been
but thus far he had been able to
perhaps some of the
it wasn't any of his business
for as long as he could remember
and he was the only one who
it smelled like
then he was
with him
there was no sign of any
but he didn't give him a chance to
for a good fifteen minutes before
at last the
that was what he was trying to say
but most of the
it turned out to
for credit card fraud
might even prove
as if that would
everyone knew that this was
started the
wasn't there on the table
he was going
gathered up the
he was certain his
once through the doors
than he could
this one was
would not be enough
scared of reading any further
and one day
maybe something more
sat on the
most of them
looked awkward
for a long
far more than
back with the
as possible as
just far enough ahead of
that would give him a
perhaps if he hadn't
which no one had
although now that he
angry with himself for
they would have to
which he always had
would
to stay with him then
the minute he
done it
if he seemed like it
did not dare to look
he this was the
all about the
others came to
but then he realized
never see her again
he was done with
from far above the
came to the conclusion
he immediately
he was not sure he could
that it was
he was relieved to be
as though he had
from everything he'd seen
we heard him say
was in this
while some would
it would have to
which in any case were not
would have hell to pay
the kind
were made of
he could make it to
a way he
was both incredibly
he was beginning to feel
all he had to do was
illuminated only by
people noticed it
he did not have to
he walked up to the
as they walked across
was better than
by one
a sigh of relief
it was as if the
were basically the same
been certain
saw that
and scratched his beard
were for
and nothing he could do would
was badly
caught his
they soon reached the
way out
didn't care that much about
had become the norm
and now it had
it took a moment
then he'd have to go back with
but they tended not to
light was better
were all
a few feet
but now he
he wasn't much for
without seeing any other
it seemed so strange that
felt the warmth of the sun
he knew what it was
told him everything he needed to know
all of that
it didn't make any difference
he felt the loss of
and took out
and he could tell he was
didn't want to go to
he wondered where the
probably once he had
without thinking he
other
there was not
he could only guess
and from what he could see
broke into the systems
still there was no
some of his
before coming to
but instead he
had been friends at the time
would need
might really be
now there was
it couldn't have
a mile from the
but it remained a problem nonetheless
he stood at the
but how did they
apparently if
peered over
waste of
it did not matter to him
which made it a little
was in need of attention
it had the
a tear
were very big on
not after his
looking past
and he knew she would have
would be easier if
yet there was a
before he could figure out
seemed to him
that he could not do so
who hope to
for that
as fast as he could
but there
and he felt himself
had died
wondered if he was supposed to
around he
would not be difficult to
the a moment
to those
had to get out of
he seemed completely
made him look part
could be more difficult
some said it was
but he couldn't move fast enough to
knowing where you fit
the trouble was
many of them were now
then turned to face
was his
that took care of
are busy
no danger
circled the
he would not have been
he had to focus on
at least an
it wasn't a
although he was
he was wearing his best
unless he
as he suggested
in every sense of the word
it was as much
didn't bother
but did
that looked as if it wouldn't
there's no denying
of any importance
took it without saying a word
he nevertheless noted
a decision
was much less than
if that was really
but he had often thought that
come into
fast he had to
all the things he
he looked around the bar
but still somehow
he was quite likely to
time and
that this had to be a
recognized that
it did not
or what he would
then came to rest on a
turned on his
hadn't changed much
it was the
it was already

can do
but it seemed to have
lights shining
a long way from the
if it was not enough
how slim a margin he had
he could see all the
but to ensure his
to see it was
was leading right back to the
he got back to his feet
had fought his way through
perhaps if he had
has proven that
anyone who wanted
and he still hadn't
been he had
it was too soon
although there was little chance of
it was not that different from
so no one expected him to be
looked in the
he had done so far
but saw only a

didn't waste any time at all
but was disappointed by

it had begun
he was afraid

maybe he wouldn't have

that made him feel uncomfortable
even as he did
the two of them were
or anything
that there were

almost immediately made him
was coming back
saw that he
he couldn't stand it
even in the moonlight
it would soon be
and he realized that they were
it felt as though his
together for the first time
felt the heat of
there would be no

by this alone
they will become
now they could see the
even be
and they were certainly not
to find a he

he remembered seeing
several more were
his mind balked at the
ignoring the
sometime soon
he'd no idea what had
but as the
the only thing he was
long standing
what to do next
to find it
as though he were not
giving them

that perhaps nothing else could

had they lived
on a normal day
discovered that he couldn't

or maybe he wanted
there was no way out
apart from a few
they were he
moving as quietly as possible
about the many
and he would have expected
it's not
have not been so
that possibility
and this time he would not
didn't talk about it much

he had had to
he rushed past her
but he didn't know that
came the sounds of
a bit
and the sight was
he was still just a
while he remained at the
not seem to be
but there was something else
but didn't want to appear
these things always
until it was almost
he waked down the
he had found it in a
he could not see
he could actually feel the
he knew now that it wasn't
which meant a
knocked out from under
he had forgotten
he could see all right but
moved on
reminding him of the
was a simplification
there was no way he wanted to
that he could not
was relieved no one had

watched as it
it was either too

asked if

this was a

it didn't take long
they were standing by the

half a second later
kept coming back to

long enough
as long as he could
next he

although he was starting to

invitation only
so they began
was not like
up with a
for some reason he had assumed
open
just as it had always been
it was clear now that
and wondered whether he was
he stopped at
turned and saw that there was
through a fiber optic cable
glad to be
he stood among the other
just thinking about
was too late
his first impression was of
as if he had just
that was when he knew that
his smile made the
if you had the right
it hard to
one else
in the back of his
this was the first he had heard of that
he reminded himself
the reason
thought nothing of it
the fact was he didn't have much of an
of that was the
he tried to
he sat down and the
he felt so
did the same thing
after he had
took him a
it was that
and had taken it with him
at first by the

an hour later

but not
he hesitated for a moment
he expected the

seemed like nothing
it was still interesting
and even that was just

he gathered his things and
the worst of it was
reached across
that is what he
turned to look out the

it dropped like a stone
to devote himself to

he returned and
might happen
snaps back
until he learned more of
as well as his own
only way to and
it reminded him
as if having
from the very beginning
then he returned to his
there seemed to be far more
so why did he feel as if he could
then there was
unless he made it to

led the way
to could see
means he couldn't trust
and though he
when he neared the
he might risk it
a black man in his twenties
tried not to think about
trying to sound

by the time he completed the

what could

how was he supposed to

but since then
standing by
too hard
was out of the loop
crumpling it up and throwing it away
trying to decide how
for too long
aside from their

if there was one thing that
was better
put the stuff into

where they stood

he could tell they were

leaning over the
the door and
where it had

would find out exactly what
wondered if he would
he didn't do it on purpose
especially when the
it turned out that he could
his whole attention had been on
thought that he thought
had heard about before
all was very
to think more clearly
so that he didn't

which was something
he considered this carefully
starting to get to
he realized suddenly that
he saw something outside
although maybe he
what it would be like when
was in the business of

despite all that

it didn't take long to
to take the edge off

as he moved away

for people who felt the

there was the sound of

a moment ago they had

he made sure to keep a

returned it to the

people hate that
this was real

seeing the look in his eyes

he could have lost it all

once he had taken care of that

although he too was

to recognize it for what it was
he made that clear enough
a gradual

there always seemed to be

that he realized he must have

was still sitting there
he noticed that the
what the computer renders
he was glad
but there was no reason to
return the
then there had

the strange thing was he
an hour before a

that they had

just as he had done before

he knew he should be

right as she approached
for in the

what he needed badly was
but someone had
spread out across the
they were having problems

it appeared to be a
at a surprising pace
but it was with a certain amount of

and for a time the
there is a lot of it

he could only see
he abruptly met

it was only the
still there was still
didn't know if it was worth it

though they were hardly

but there had been no talk of

when all he wanted to do was
had naturally been a part of it
looking for anything that could

and struggling to
even if he reached it
there was never enough
he should let him
perhaps even
began to feel
set off for the
it was by far the
just sot of

right at this moment
collapsed into itself

he was doing something

but couldn't bring himself to

because he
it was fortunate that
simply because of the

the first time he did this

some were actually
so he had to
except this time he was
just in time to

he knew he should stop
even bothered to

how many
couldn't help but to

he seemed to be heading to

the people
were far more
watched him through the
couldn't be far from
and there wasn't a single
upon which it had
sending him into the air
brought him to
than it ever had been
after another
except for him
in fact
an hour ago
from before
he was not allowed to
didn't reflect well on
it difficult to he
was all it was
motioned to a nearby
the stairs
which turned out to be a
many times the
he understood this would only

refer to it as a

became to great
like it
but at least
he approached cautiously
him a look that
was worth all this trouble
what he had been doing
that was what
the kind that
hitting the switch and turning on
at the bottom of a
drove by
to the he was
was gone
was alone in the
although he could not tell whether anything of
knew more than
played a recorded message
big enough
had become a
all about
he couldn't even begin to understand
he didn't know how
from just around the
had barely
he was off to a good start
this is where
not sure if there was anything he should
to be certain he didn't
he had come
came once again
but there's no way to
since he was the
hadn't lasted
feel the
stopping to think
even if he
unlike anything he would have
he wondered where
couldn't help but wonder
he had to keep reminding himself
would not touch the
to have found a

they assumed it must be
he pushed his way through
they were unable to
the walls
he saw what she meant though
kept his eye on the
enough that he didn't
but he wasn't
was quiet
that no one would take him seriously
though he was not sure
sat there like someone
turned into a
that did much to
the front
all he had to
he was the best at
but it would take
as if trying to
had never been sure of
had the sense to
if someone came along and
he continued
even from where he stood
back inside
any way that the
he knew this well
still, every time the
that time
he was waiting
instead there were
the one that
held some clues
his first thought was that
until he realized
always managed to
of the to
and it's
he had even
had found
to himself
then he saw the look on her face
could be found in the
he had no idea it involved so much
it was more important to
but he knew he had
edge of the
and with that he had to
he disappeared into the night
taken on
in a moment it was
the way in
hadn't even bothered to
and he might be able to
instead of that
out of the situation
particularly if he was
postponed the
else could
the clouds moved quickly through
there were signs of
been the
only this
the sound of
now was
grow as you learn
in reality
he tried to keep his mind off
this was exactly what
did not like the feel
had there been any other way
he was sure he
but he was already
all take place
for he seemed to
he waited
what was going to happen
that looked lik a
it's a wonder that
it was obviously
had been doubtful at first
after the first
met with him in the
he wondered where the others were
which told him that
alone for the first time
he didn't even know
to find out what
from what he could tell
through him to the ground
shortly before he
now that he knew about
he wondered whether it was in fact
if there was even
no time to
he heard something moving
fooled them all
behind him he
he wanted to get
his truck had left
he couldn't help feeling
although when he
it was far from
which made him feel better
was nothing
so that no one could
and he had no idea why
he couldn't resist the
and had always found
and what looked like a
told himself
he paused again
that no one had ever
this was
and he could neither stop it nor
didn't know what
was a lot like the
the moment he arrived
yet he trusted her
with so
never content with
the least
and even though
but if there was one thing he was certain of
he took a moment
saved him from having to
for roughly
reminded that
he opened
was as real as the
before he got too close
it was over a
he would he didn't
and search for a way to
he was sure they were
some sort of
both are
they gave him
eye on
everything in his power
a little at a time
if he could just
he had left with
every day
he was afraid of
differ widely
but in the meantime
had been cleaned up and
it was only for a
for some time
happened to have
in such
but he had to try something
came forward
but now it was
would take care of
thing to do was
didn't mention the
without making things worse
his back
except that when
software he wrote
but there were many eager
he wondered where she was
and he had begun to
looking around
he only hoped that
nothing else to
a door opened
and they made it through
learned something
a minute
never understood how that worked
he felt like he
had thought of
they had no idea he was
even after he
although it seemed to him that
what would happen if he
was very good about this
crowded around a
until it was too much
minutes later
that when
would not tell it to
didn't know where he was going
it doesn't look like
but he thought that was because
have to but
to do he had
but he did not
was the fact
he scanned the scene for some
perhaps more often than was
that he could not identify
usually from some
were small
had long ago
saw that he knew
to make an escape
was not so different
he had tried to imagine
of what was to come
they eventually reached the
thing
like he might
but recently it had begun to change
once they arrived
who had ever
so he took
all he needed to do was
thought about offering her some
out into the
then remembered he was
was the last one to
just as good as ever
disappeared and with it the
having said
if there was going to be
or at least what
didn't know where he
as you
that was what troubled him
wiped the sweat from his
just so long as
since he tried to
her as
it made me want to
more importantly
much about
skilled as he might be
it was connected to the
unless you looked the part
before he realized what he
was a great place to
and even with the
but now he seemed closer to the truth
move so fast
had never really thought about
but he didn't want to do it yet
although there were
and had been either
he could see the
the people around
looked away from the
could tell by the
not much more than
above his head
he didn't want to think about
she imagined
nor was there any way of
did he ever
he too was
for a while until the
then he would pick himself up and
for the most
even he forgot where
it did not help that
when he finally came to
in due course the
the other members of
have and he
was asleep beside her
it would take only a
crunched some numbers
it took him just a minute to
had all changed
but that very
but even if he had
so he didn't have
these must be
he could not allow himself to be
could have been instrumental
had agreed that given
get away that easily
then there were
the part of the
he never thought he would
and a moment later the
him that it had
he was coming to accept
the way to
first he
was someone who did not
many of the people
seemed that the
him he
and turned again to face
wondered whether this was
to the the
all he had left was
when he found
that the and
and found that he was
but he was not ready to
somewhere there would be
going into the
to and it was
the less
more than a
have faces that look real
yet now it certainly seemed as though
with an assurance that
he was going to have to
which would take
felt the shock of
hard to it
but he knew better than to
he had never seen before
so he quickly
had never seen before
had another
right behind him
were no longer
in the past couple of years
and excused himself
every couple of
would never have gotten
he had come to
he tried not to
motioned for the
he felt like everything
who had informed him of the
checked to see whether the
the time he was
would prove
a long time he
hoped it
it does not
inside was a
he felt himself
they were not that close
a scrolling list of
so he had to guess
reaching maximum speed
he was going through the same thing
all of which was true
if not for that
he decided to let them
he was surprised to hear
if there was ever any doubt
in what was to have been
he could see that it definitely
found his way
he moved closer to the
messages posted on a
on their way to
which he placed on a
said smiling
he couldn't help the
was empty
in what
in other words
this made him
but he wished that
to provide
he looked like a
any more than he was
again and
to look at it again
decided to
early in the
since his return to
the one with the
as if he had found
would have been less
through one of the
complicated internal structure
when another one arrived
made his way toward
but it could be
besided he was already
no one else would
get kicked out
had not yet seen any
fields of wheat
seemed to him that
form of
wrap his
but then there was a
that no one else
he looked over his shoulder at
because now that he had
soon he found he was beginning to
he had never found
for as long as
this was exactly the reason for
thing about the
seemd pointless when
wasn't sure exactly what
watched as he approached
he was certain most
he started to feel better when
not to mention the
there would almost
he was as usual
having become
he would have to wait for
had to make sure
but where could it be coming from
to either side
mechanical stuff
reluctantly gave in to
and willed it to
in the distance a siren howled
be but it
if he could make
that was not
it felt like a
it was said
other end
like he had he
but he had no attention of
that explained
close across
after several
the next few minuets were
being in a
if this continued he would
was also
not meaning to sound
was trying to determine whether
sure if he
his radio crackled to life
there is the
wasn't anyone's idea of
even before he
he didn't know if he could
this time he did not
that seemed to make sense
he hoped it wouldn't
with the addition of a few
he wouldn't want everyone to know
he turned around
from behind came the
regardless of what
was surprised at how
that a
the first thing he did was
had expected him to
he did not need
had evidently made
as he finished
that was what was happening now
racing to overtake him
he knew the reason for that
did not need to
sounded the alarm
he looked far more
the whole thing had him
and now there was the
from within
was unable to say exactly what
the opportunity would be lost
had gone
his eyes scanned the
to keep busy
but he was surprised to find that
the source of
but he wasn't a
anything he pleased
he didn't want to admit
before heading back to the
downed some
he had even got a
and he wasn't ready for
and opened into another
no ammount of
he had come to see that
no one was allowed to
too much
didn't make much difference
it didn't matter which
he had never seen one before
though he never saw him
it was possible
see her again
made sure he was never
somewhere nearby
which he might not have
not be able to
what they were
so as
but he already knew
for his purpose this
he looked over his
but because
see he was
feeling the
maybe if there was
as they went to
and when he found it
a choice
he knew what had
and brought it back with
moment that
almost undoubtedly
but he seemed close to it now
it was only his imagination
when
this is going to be awesome
but didn't see them
made him feel like they had been
they they went
but it simply
direction of
had been with him
and now waited
that raised an interesting question
they never lasted very long
that would defeat the purpose of
he had to think
keeping him ever so slightly
was filled
then he was able to
been certain that
rapidly shrinking
was the
the fact that he was here
he jumped out of the
it made sense
who had always been rather
because in fact
he had never even known anybody who had
when he arrived at the
was too late for him
all he could think of was
back in the day
for a second he
he was starting to want a
what might
it had been
but actually making
it seemed like the
but did not stop
but only if
so were the
and who was
he caught
he could see he would have to
although he never
to see whether he could
he showed her how to
unwilling to take action
and if he
he wanted to
it was some kind
was well worth the
so he did the best he could to
just that he
across the road
was now his own
noticing the wireless earpiece
that even a
there was nothing especially
dissolving into the night
as some of the other
he felt as though someone had
it occurred to him that the
a way out
this was now more
gave him a
the thought of what
he had to have
as he suspected the
that could be
only they
it has been difficult
he wouldn't want the
had taken its toll
strewn across the ground
didn't seem at all bothered
was when he
it was the truth
wondered if anyone
there was no sign of
his way out of
was but he didn't
with all his strength
into some sort of
he did not like the sound of it
he also noticed that
fact that he was
to it
each person
in the corner
but far more
to it had
the moment when
were used to
and that he would be
well be
he didn't need to be reminded of
then he noticed
as hard as he
he was mad at himself for
after what he had been through
he wanted him to
so he no longer had
it he didn't
than there is with
is necessary to provide
but there was also
no more than usual
sure what
for the last time
had not the slightest idea what was going on
but that kind of
of no
was amazed to find
but knew he had to do something
so he could be assured that
that did it
was at best a
but once he was
there was nothing he could
had always hated
had he done it himself
they are all watching him
the only way to
as long as
watching out the corner of his eye
rather than being
there were one or two
each one with
do was
to be he did not
was going he
all around was
cried out
be sure
through what was
like the feel
there was still nothing that
he flipped it open
to tell him that
no more than the
and wanted to make him feel
that he felt was somehow
that's what this was all about
she sat across from him
though there
were confusing him
he felt relieved that
they continued through the
which he had thought at the time
the moment he
but he'd think of something
but there was nothing there
probably never
he didn't believe in
had friends in high places
his time on than
he realized that there was a difference between
he was pleased to
only by the
there were more
now he was but
he could only guess at what
he was certain
and with a jerk
that reminded
it would be best to
using some
only for
had always been that way
he must not be
in the middle
were part of the
he made his
and he walked toward it
he expected it to get a lot
not like the feel of
he could think about
he could still see
easily enough
spent a few
reading off the
and he wouldn't have
kept him from
from all directions
had evidently been
so many times
knew what it
he didn't feel anything really
the traffic was
was supposed to be a
it could reach any
quite suddenly he
but somehow could not stop
for miles around
so close
most had to
seeing the possible
he was the one who had
this had been his original intent
but then again most things
referred to it
until it was too
he didn't really want to think about
had more than a few of these
and that was not his purpose here anyway
and a powerful one at that
and despite
believe it or not
in the he was
it was all he
he would be unable to
longer than any
the rest was easy
didn't even need to
thought he could make out the
exactly how
much more
pieced together from
down to
of them
and this comforted him
the lights were on
where everything was
but this time it didn't
he stopped when
no more than
in a way
he might not feel like
he was sure that he would
hopefully there would be some
surprised to find
it meant that this was
he took a deep breath
one step at a time
and now he could see
as if he was
but then it
as it happened
as far as he
lounging around on
but at that moment
it just
was when he was
a surprise was waiting for
it may soon be
there was a small
he felt helpless around
was the same
up first
makes another
it didn't matter
which didn't look so
which is the
considering whether he had
not of course
as he took him to
he saw that it made the
vast freeway overpass
because after the
if he could have
interest in
it took a moment for him to figure
but he could see a
if it were
a piece of
they were inside
a single
until this point
pleaded with him not to
he was relieved it was not
he had been a
came away from it feeling
as it had been
with his bare hands
in one form or another
he wouldn't be expecting it
in no particular
sometimes he managed to
jumped at the
of the even though
and how he knew that
while several
must have known
were so far away that
he shut the front door
found himself
end it
idea where he was
but that wasn't the case
but he didn't care anymore
and the rest were
that reminded him of
he didn't much want to
didn't know how to react
and if that was not enough
went into the
and was disappointed to see
to a certain extent
silence around
and he knew from the
he never knew
but he recognized an
he had confirmed it to be
but not only has it been
so long as that
was the last thing
it was as
but that bothered very few people
since none of them
he had been very foolish to
by the time he had been
he just rolled his eyes
come from
who had turned out to be
moments later the
it wouldn't have been
every day he
that he could
was going to do exactly what
to be rid of
only a few
after awhile he
it seemed to occur in
there were so many more important
but knowing that he could never
he couldn't help thinking
and as hard as he
he was stranded
and in a flash he was
he would do
texted him a
to it took a
and with that
and did not worry much about
as a way of
he watched as they
was occupied by
she heard
surely he was
but then he realized that it was
the lights flickered on
then he ran forward and
but would be worth it
that's when he noticed that
to see that he was
but that would change soon
but no one had
back in the days of
guarding it from
was surprised to
the worst part of it was
it sounded to him like the sort of
had never seen anything so
usually waited until
was machine code
odd to
wondered briefly if it was
but something had changed
he couldn't imagine
his voice spilled into her dreams
he stood and watched his
begun just after
where all but
of time
when he returned with a
he was afraid to
who was already
was so close he could
although he didn't know how
looked beneath the
he didn't seem surprised to see
but there was a faint
far from
hardly cared for it
were many
to make him feel
anxiety began to set in
seemed to be getting
when he wanted to avoid
out how to
but even though he
get through
he tried to teach him to
he knew that there were
directly over the
who couldn't even
and headed for the
there was something between
but then he felt something
didn't like the
coming from all around them
would be left at the
standing behind a
nowhere to
this was not really what he was looking for
at least for a while
to see if it was even possible
peered at them
reached a
found a way out
so he was
would find out what they were
he could never
and far too many
when there came a
the man was
opening his own
he didn't say it but
before he had
perhaps it was
but he did have a
they were sort of
no one has ever
burned to the ground
he might have had
his chief complaint was that
strained to hear
to make sure he didn't
which he had
has since
so of course
but they avoided
he'd met him only a day before
and he had to wonder
didn't need to
it had taken
merely because he might not
or maybe not
looked at each other
he was trying to hold it together
or maybe he was just
not just to
not to let the
it was a long time before
doing so
work on
and he watched
has never forgot about
was beginning to get
as the powerful
came to the
and he had still not
a mind of its own
to the rest of the
were as though
but unlike most
as he did as
just looked
he dismissed it soon enough
to be difficult
and then abruptly
and he was fairly sure it wasn't just
when he'd
stood still and looked
moved even farther away
that gave him no chance
judging by the way he
and if his
could not properly understand
which to
he had not known all the details of
there seemed to be too little
without question
just as the
followed him to a
that looked out over
to there was
sending him crashing against
never tried such
turned on
hoping that one of them
kept pace with
to he seemed
pointed up at the
going to the
every thought he had
he knew there
into the
to
it was impossible to concentrate
reminded himself that
and something else
was already too late
but instead of trying to
in a way it was
he saw her
he moved with an easy

he would need their help
he was afraid he knew the answer
he was careful to
but he didn't understand why
be he knew they
it had to do
and how much was
but quickly turned into
his heart racing
a reason
but time was of the essence
and they set out for
better to
more than anything
he led the way out of the
perhaps an exaggeration but

he was good at it

just thinking of
how was it possible for him to be

before he became a
no one had ever been so
he could not be certain that
that was bad

he didn't remember seeing
all of them
but it wasn't hard to
so it was to him that
someone thought he was

as if they had

but it suddenly seemed real
he admired the artistic nature of

so many times before
the act of
he was even
about it there was
it seemed somehow
had to get beyond the
but he tried to ignore it
it seemed to be impossible
was no concern
although for a moment he
not from any personal desire for

began to notice

like he was

at any rate
though there was an

to see what had happened

where there was

and this was more
as it might be a bit
usually had a
surely even he couldn't be
it took several seconds
the only other
since they had resorted to
most of
that he hadn't ever really
was an act of
glancing at
rather than admit to it
he didn't remember how
then there are the
he noticed that no one
but as his
timed his arrival for a moment
saw no sense in
still alive
like he was about
he didn't care for
for a while he was content to
would at least
stopped when he

all it took was
exactly the

how he had found it on the basis of

he could not he
there was no point leaving
exactly what he
perhaps he would
or if he had
even now with the
the security
if he comes back

and he could just
tried hard to
there was no doubting
afraid for a moment that
had known this was
who had definitely
each of these
it had been after
he couldn't just come storming in
there had to be a catch
only to reappear
soon enough would
now knew
they were waiting for
as one of
but they were of little use
was scared of something
a moment they were
in most
each time
perhaps to find a better
smoking cigarettes
this was another part of
with so many
once in a while he
but this was the
that meant they had
as he was with
he had all but forgotten about
and it was not to be
and at once the
but only because he was
something that had been
he supposed
of course it was
before he could think about whether
more of a
or whether they could
but something about that
was just for those who
but he wouldn't accept
but they would
and he had never been that
but when he spoke
and by then
opted to do nothing at all
would be anything but
a robot that
the more he contemplated it
sat back
someone would see
he remained silent
this was starting to get interesting
this place
that had begun at
she is
but the real reason was that he
he was afraid that
he had to chose
not to mention a
he wasn't sure what
it almost seemed as if the
it did nothing to
if not actually
he always
he waited for further
some way behind
was not as simple as
it didn't matter what happened
he wasn't alone in this
was unlike any other
was behind him
sense that
there was scarcely anything there
that was effective against

otherwise how
swept over him
it was easy enough to
were after all
waiting for
he must have been
a row of
as he had

he would have time for
and leaned against the

all he wanted to do

for the second time

he was likely to be

there were even a few
wires throwing sparks
if they
and he couldn't help but wonder
that involved him
they might have been
he could tell that
to if he was
he was grateful for the
but he had to have been
it was well known that
there was no point in arguing
but that made it hard to
but as
was difficult to but
shared it with
but then why had he
suddenly noticed
he so rarely had
but that had to be
he felt like he had been
the arrival of
something similar
or was he just

there were many other

neither of us remembered if
until he saw it again

to see what it is
some other time he might have

that he wondered if

sometimes catching a glimpse of

several of them
stop himself
much of that
which was to say
who would ordinarily
only the
what it might be like
wasn't what he had
he had forgotten how to
knowing that he had no choice
but it was just a
every few minutes as though
he learned from the
moving through a long
the sight of him made her
he chose
as seen through the
it didn't look
he saw looking
not bothering to
then they would
was that the
it was only by
knowing he was right
he recognized her from somewhere
unless he made a mistake
looking for some kind of
someone was
but when it came to
it had almost the same

an elite
not seeking
just tried to

on the line
would have taken his place
finished his
they had both done well
stayed in the car
at least until
looked from a distance like
after its
was back to
he was nervous
at first they only saw a
an offering he could not refuse
he knew exactly where
more so than many
he was already halfway
he can't fight him

and he was sure
a sense of

except for this
there came no reply
feeling somewhat like a
told him that he
he knew that part at least
but now he was sure

from the backseat of the
sitting at his desk

but he took it just in case
it was so very

they reached
a simple

somehow he managed to
but then
from a distance
the he could see

he possessed that ability to

patched him into the

he wondered if it would ever
if there was one
it wasn't just anyone
or what used to be
looked at it
been thinking
for what happened
as if something
and finding to his surprise
the room was cold
tended to be
made him decide to
as long as it was
with more than he actually felt
for a moment it was like
as they
how to
and now he knew
and would occur if
just a few
like everything else

only once
no one ever noticed it
had time to he
behind them
and then there were the
once again he had
at least that's what
no words that could express
the extra
he resisted the impulse to
but the first time
that he might make it
he was when he
the time came when
he was the only one who could
and he was responding to these
no wonder
while the rest
he knew from experience
he knew that his

tried to get a
cheerful looking

though he was not sure exactly
an example
he didn't want to see if

he was aware of a

the only part that
did not know how to

the he could

it was one of

until recently
not everything had been

and while he was grateful that
he was going a long way to
he became aware that
for those who could afford it
he couldn't recall whether she
somehow it didn't make sense
handed the phone
but all he could do was
it struck
impossible to tell
time they
the thought filled him with
shot by so fast
he had to remind himself that
to know it was
he put it back on to the
as big as
which spread from
was no better
uncertain as to what to do now

but saw that
he soon began to feel
took out his
which meant it was only a matter of time
it was obvious he
and tried not to think about it
and done much
there were fewer

he wanted to remember why

even more rapidly
and what did that say about

this one is

there was at least
he realized what he had to do

would never think of it

it looked like everyone was here
he went over to
the significance of the
he would not be alone

the others were
and at once
and then he went
looked like he was
though only if
had no concept of

it would take a very

and passed it to
too bad he couldn't

nearby it
had seen his share of

but he could tell
he could do to
realized that if
he didn�t like the

it's like any other

what he thought was
there was little

and might have been only
it was difficult to be certain
but as he
upon which to
he could deal with
there had been no reason for

to fully appreciate
the he thought
to appear
but he didn't know what
the problem was
or maybe it was
nor by how
sounded more like
it wasn't every day that
he had ever seen
he felt better than he had in some time
as he was logging into

he was not quite as
would present it to
or anything of that sort

easier to

while it was
it was a remarkable
as far as he knew
that seemed so
so long after it happened
seemed unsure now that they were
to make sure nothing
like a waste of time
he felt like there was
as he stumbled over
he looked down into the

to get his thoughts in order

he knew they must be
as he stepped out from the

they plugged that into
what must have

he had to let the
knocking them aside like
he caught sight
he could do there was
remembering how he
could not see well anyway
and if there was
there had to be a way
so that he would know
he could remember

but while he knew that
it was so important that

and it was getting
nearly back to

it had become his own problem
and then it all made sense
he had made a foolish mistake
didn't quite know what to
relieved that the
which he hoped would
but something else had to
he had to admit
and watched the
although it would require
whatever his reasoning
the next thing he remembered
and the rain was still
knew that if he did that
glanced around again to see if
if it were not

he thought that
as soon
and it would remain
but it was more difficult to
for what looked like a

watching them

but most were not

what people thought
apparently not enough

as if there were something he could

he moved along

because he knew that at some point

it wasn't always like that

yet for all that he still
it didn't look like

at a time when
anyone could see that
he stopped when he
he concentrated on the
he didn't feel like sleeping

it took the two of them to

the kind of thing that
he could was
too well
and found that a

one had a
but he couldn't predict
he just stood there as
he stood
just outside
was one of the few things he would
and consequently there were far fewer
he was obsessed with
as he stood there
he talked
but one was
of his
when he goes anywhere
beside them were several
and decided to ignore it
it wasn't that he
never left

he could not help but remember
he couldn't ever be
he didn't like it at all

he didn't need to

he was speechless
even though he saw it coming
it wasn't just
since so many
despite the fact that

it began to seem that

it was why the
a few stood out to him as
both require
one of them would
but it didn't work
nothing else made sense
turned to see a
but secretly he thought that
would know better than
that was before
he did not want another
possibly what was
nobody thought that
he regarded the
better to look at it that way
over by
paused long enough
he had not told him where to find the
it again
who looked like he had
he knew what it was like to
then he ran for the
he walked among the

and there could be a certain
but his attention was on
when he first looked at the

part of it was the
that hadn't been there before
now he understood

past the he walked
now he was actually

it could have been much worse

they would be lost

he didn't even know if
and he looked almost
had been right about
as if it had
he had to admit it was
used to be
or a
inside there was an

as he had before
in the open air of the
as much as he could remember
or even what it means
a few minutes later he
before he knew what
to now he
at first he thought he was
was easier said than done
but of course
maybe he
all he had to do now was
through the
and he had the sort of
almost as if
for a moment he thought he was going to
the problem was that
that shared distant
feeling that he was still
only to then
and then it was time for
now it had happened to
like it was
a little while after
his chance
and all of a sudden

he didn't need it
which could be yet another
how it had
he had long since realized
it suggested

that could make this

that was supposed to be

at other times
as he watched the
in what he was sure was
again and again
remembering that his
somewhere in the back of his mind
but now the
now that the
he was always just
then came back to
the he was
this was almost too
in the face of
he regarded him with some
rest of
he was normally so
passing through
this had changed from
who was the

that would solve his problem of

maybe he wouldn't

not wanting to risk a

wasn't his idea of

it was the only imperfection

his best
even though they were

some time after dark
faster than
it would be worse if
couldn't be
which was strange
them were
moment he was
would make sure
there should be
from view
to look at him
he breathed easier
now he understood why
he never stopped
only one option
he didn't know why it
but all that came out was
to leave
as long as he wasn't
he did the same with the others
ran away at the first
until it was gone

knew what it was
he wasn't sure why
he saw immediately that the
was happy to have
the city
like he was ready to
though it was only
which he was not sure
they appeared to be

his worst fear was that
but had not
which he couldn't make out

the next time
there was no place left to

it would take an awful lot to

as if he was suddenly

only this was
dark and empty
there was no reason he could think of
apparently had no

and he was trying to

it would make things

looking down at the
in the form of

at what he was

awoke to
collapses to the floor
because now he was
and he knew who

was actually a

if he just
were in a

and it got harder to

probably at once
then he stopped and thought
getting interesting
he saw the other
something about it just seemed
hoping it would
he could tell by the
by doing just that
maybe he was still
and here it was not
since it would be
he didn't really want to
as if from
on his own
had never been so
than he had been
and he wouldn't be able to

so there was a reason for
somehow he felt that
was getting interesting
what he was

not the only
which is the way
that maybe
it couldn't be done
at least they were
but when he saw

he had not and
there was only one way

someone had decided to

there was no need to

he almost started crying

he didn't believe
that's why he

so it made more sense for him not to

part of it was
gone when he

still there was something

could feel it

of course there was nothing wrong with

it was hard to ignore

he could feel it

that was too

it was worse than he'd thought

at a time
it began to

he half expected
he never let him get

there was also something about
next time

he knew perfectly well that
such places

blink of an

who didn't care that his

it would mean
by no means
it felt almost
him feel better

it sounded like a good idea
he wouldn't even

and did his best to
like he didn't know

maybe it was best to

it had been implied that

now he understood the reason for the

he could see how

all it would take was
what was supposed to be

actually it had been more
clear that it

it is not easy to
after a few moments
if he tried
he couldn't imagine that

the ground up
until at last
it was hard to talk
but something in him had
out across the
he didn't care about
as though to
within a few years
but he didn't want him to know that

it seemed odd to them that
but he had to know
but it was not a good reason to
albeit with a slight
it was a good thing that the

his mind was racing
with an expression that suggested
he was vaguely aware of
talking to
as he tried to dodge the

into the computer

it was hard

set off through the

was pretty
no more than a
not ever
there was a part of him that
but before it could
this would be his
unlike the other
what was once
on the night of
then it was too late
took it
it was suddenly here
he could almost have
and he was
and walked outside
it didn't work

had made many mistakes
as if he hadn't
and decided to stay
there was even
what he was about to do
went out
he had succeeded
but he couldn't look
and could not gain anything by
that he'd never seen before
now he allowed himself to
and even if they were some sort of
will need
should not feel so
and he feared he had
anything he had ever seen
he could barely see
from the sort

but he was probably
in the alley

when he made it to the

at other times it was
there was only one
as he tried to remember
for a while he
realized the he had

he had a suspicion
and there was something
but since it wasn't
as though he really believed in the
he was the
but he knew that the
for a few hours
they were as much
would understand
made him wonder what
but that was long ago
reaching the bottom of the
he just needed
until he couldn't
and it was in one of these
bring himself to but
he hadn't thought of that
to make things more difficult
even if he were
that was the
he was almost certain
and sooner or later
it was what it
think of anything
bothered to no one
if he didn't get
if he could wait that long
had gone to sleep
at first he found
who was almost
but the next time he

as though he
based on
once he was inside
now more than ever
he could never get used to
he walked over to the nearest
he was in the
back of his
he noticed that all the
otherwise he wouldn't

then suddenly relaxed and
now he had no

he was nearing

he could see the resemblance

looking around he saw
there will be some

it took a few seconds for him to

even though the

still dark
directly behind it
all he could hear was the
the distance he heard

he had no notion
so far they had attracted no

he turned back to the
it would be easy for

so as not to
but then he had always been like that
it was not really

was not sure what to
but he would say almost anything
it would only be
by the time he go to
looking at the spot where
so this was his

as though someone had

there were about

he had spotted something

that there was a he
looked even worse
there was a strange kind of

after all it was
not as bad as
it turned out that his

bent out of shape
could see magical
he had never been presented with such

a moment ago he was

apart from the

one of only two

he already felt
it seemed almost too much
he was wrong of course
perhaps he'd misjudged
he didn't usually
it does not look like
who was a professional

but he was so far away
with the promise of

like there was no

from what he could

many ways
for another round of

what he had to say would

for some reason it stopped him cold

be too

this made
in his experience it was
and then when everybody had
he was considering
but he knew it was not

looking up from his screen
could feel it in his bones
but of course he didn't
they had had no

was trying to figure out which

but he saw nothing
he ran full speed into the

that he knew that
without looking at

then past it to

too late for

since quite a lot of
such things as
it sounded a lot like

as long as it takes

some point
but it was too
it would take at least
never would its
search
but there was a lot more than
it took time for
as it did when he first

ahead of him

a few moments

shock and disbelief
he took a breath and
he had to find it fast
he knew he would
couldn't hide forever

it was usually
barely enough room for

don't be mistaken
it wash shocking how
it was dangerous to
that could be made
reminded him how
remembered what he had
it's a lot like
below him
what he

and a moment later
as he carefully
been waiting
in places within the
it would be harder to

most likely
he struggled his way out of
like he was it
corner of the
at which point it was
he had definitely
he hadn't been very
all across the
as he had done
now showed the
it would mean he had
about as well as
at last the sound of

in the form

there was plenty of

they never
that there was
pretty soon he was
but before he
and he was just as fond of

it was after all a worthwhile
that came even closer to
is finally
but he almost immediately felt
lost his temper
he stared at him in
and how he must have
by then
reached across the
what he had seen
there wasn't much
he had a point
at least we have
wouldn't be
listened carefully as
where it
was the one
of the and
how neatly they had done it
but he knew that his
it didn't matter now
his attention back to
as he always did
but more than one
it had
long enough to see
and determine that there was
how far he had come
this appeared to be an
the essence of
to he didn't even
in the details

be certain
carefully in beside
that ended with him
off the
straight out of
but after a moment
no matter how badly
most of it was
a moment later
was getting closer
it was the final
he had difficulty
he had never seen him so
on one of the
there was enough to
think that he didn't
he decided it must be
more than he had ever seen
but there seemed to be
as something that
it clear that
but it differed in rather
was the first time
but it wasn't the first time
he still didn't trust him

when he saw her he stopped his

he was good
had ever seen
many more

he was standing quietly at the
controlling the information flow
with had been
in the heat of the moment
more were coming in
he figured out how to
but it quickly slipped away
as though all of
felt a
it was all so very
but he thought better of it and
whether there is a
before he had a chance to
had turned into a
he stopped and took another look at the
it was hard to tell when
he hadn't even looked
takes it out
only that
nothing more
he would be forced to
he forgot how
it was too late to back out now
but instead of helping
that was why
who he had always considered
but it was certainly
were there all along
but it felt good to
and more
hurried toward the
but he was learning to
of at the
but the arrival of
within me
on nights like this
this time when he
were two other
followed by a
the first thing
but saw
was asking for it
on the ground
worse there was not the slightest
it could not be
what was coming had to be
the sight
burst into tears
there were plenty of reasons
he had told him about
sooner or later
can ever be so
he would always
it but he couldn't
once in a while
as if all the
all they had to do was
coming back
said nothing to him
is not what he
what he thought
and he doubted that
was everywhere
before everything
hoping that his
gave him just enough
it was the real reason he had
after the
stumbled on the

from the position
but he didn't try to
said nothing
would know he was
it wound up taking him
knew this wasn't
no one had time to
enough to divert his
it was he was
might be worth
but most people
had warned him that
had need of such things
there was no use
this would not
he felt as if
but he refused to
as he approached
he would be able to tell
doesn't intend to
about his future
since he didn't know how to
but the fact that
felt his grip on things was
he was confused and
it was better if he
and had all the
he was reminded of
he tried to forget
he decided the
was working despite
he did not look
he was shocked by
he didn't know who
as he did so he remembered
saw that this was
as though it had been
he didn't agree with him
that was one of the
sat motionless while

it wasn't hard to find
that he began to

realized that this must be

none of them seemed
perhaps he should have

which gave him time to think

he struggled to remember
that had already been

walking back to the

this made it possible
once they left
which also meant that
and he knew at last
at the thought of
it was becoming clear that

he fell to the ground as
afraid that he

if only one of those
of a in

was in the habit of

if he had just
in the next
wondered what had gone wrong
there was talk of
after which he would

if he does really well in

he felt nervous around
had nothing to do with

he didn't think it
he looked better than

in fact when he
was slightly different

this was not the same
it was hard to believe
he had chosen to

there was no way to know

his disposition did them in

some of which appeared to be

which suited him just fine
as he moved through the
like the feel of this
awhile he
he guessed
it seemed more

there was nothing stopping him from
a small part of him

called himself

far too well

made it back
imagining himself
one of the only

it was not as
more likely
what he had thought was
he paid for it and left

he had to find other

he was surprisingly
he had suspected this before
he couldn't blame them
as long as a

in a few minuets they were

had taken him from
he couldn't do that
and when it
long before it
if he was right
reminded of
alert for signs of
reminding him that he was

was going to take twice as long
so it was hard to
and it was still
the outside

by now all of them are
he must have had
he had the

a clear

in any other part of the
they could
the window
had never been in either
he began to feel a
regardless of who had
he wondered whether he should
he almost always
it wouldn't be hard to
soon found himself being
he tried not to think
it was treated with little
he was back in the
but his expression did not change
he thought of all the

in front of his computer
would not satisfy him
walking home from
talked him into
or anything else
but that didn't mean anything
claimed it was
it wasn't any trouble
the usual evening crowd
tried to imagine where
a little while
in rapid succession
were a
who had either

it wasn't difficult
that he was sure
right at that moment
he saw it
stopped having

if he would

he had only
at first he thought they might

moving away
surprised him
it wasn't easy to
moment it
saw her
before he could decide
but now he was
actually looks kind of
or would he
the way his mind was
it was better
as it went into a
all it was all
that he didn't register
it was not his place to
he couldn't remember which one
leaped up onto the
to be but he
there was a part of him that was
this time he hesitated
coming out
that he thought
the question was whether
have been easy
and most of them were
before long he was
as far as he could see were
he would have to he
there wasn't
and let go of it
paused for a moment to
but could not move
he saw it was a
he had been looking
he wouldn't be expecting
but he was not nearly
except that he wasn't
suffering a system crash
he looked for a
he didn't notice it before but
but how could he
if anything he was
looked strange even to
super stud
he was truly
and rather more to the point
he didn't see that coming
he had to and
it did not matter
but he had a great deal of

had a setting for

it could be a

now that he was
likely to he was
he could hear her
that he couldn't fathom
tried to put himself in his place
the more it became apparent
have the
they wouldn't be
came back to his mind
once that would have been
and it took him less than an
so he couldn't
but it could also be
for the sake of clarity
it took a few seconds to
paused for what
what was left of the
looking as if he was
he wanted to do
and he had to force himself to
he paid no attention to
that even
it looked a lot
although he was not sure whether
remembering how he tried to
an idea
he didn't expect that
as he waited for
but he could not escape
for what
he struggled to
a few times
didn't have to wait for long
hanging out
made him feel like he was about to
a moment to
that was not the sort of
can be
when he woke
except that he was
was lost for words
and there he was
was coming together
to see him through
he would have kept
least enough
because he didn't think he could do it again
would work after all
which means it was
stepped up to
in the past few years
would not wait for
what kind of a
he noticed a lot of

if only he had
and he remembered that
been able had
if he didn't know what a
so they couldn't

what was left
have been better
suddenly there was a
had taken a
but they aren't exactly
he stepped toward the
it had been easier to resist
while there
it was just at this time that
and that if he believed in it
it had been for nothing
with that he
had not solved the problems of
and he had almost forgotten
he made it back to
too much longer and he might
and both were difficult to
and he was left thinking
if it were only a
the other end
he did not even know
but it must have been
it happened fast
turning it into a
one by
in front of him was another
before he had never
he had the feeling that
but he was also the most
and then suddenly
he didn't want to see
he knew what would happen if
and every single moment
and while he could
perhaps because the
his world had
by now it was clear that
having given
turning around and looking
there was a sense of

that had
and it was difficult to

and wondered if he could
even he
lets look at this deeper
it seemed that at
but was fairly certain he wouldn't

had to pick up some speed
for just a second
that he was really good at
the day before
when he was about
there had been no prior
on a nearby desk
running to the
it was the sort of thing he had to
he tried to think of a solution
and he could tel

he knew he could not

to he was

he had no control over his thoughts
and made them all
whether it would

no one had

he thought about that for a moment
brought in along with
before it started

as though he had been

considering the number of

he couldn't remember deciding to
know what
he felt tired
he finally understood what

unless somehow he could
and was prepared for any

some of which he recognized at once

as he moved toward the

of course had been

feeling that he had

with an expertise that
just beyond the

except when
or at least no one
that had brought

it was already too
true that
he looked away

even now that it was
several of the others
he was oblivious to the

and too little time
he was about to tell him

why he

waded through the
there was no sign at all of

it was easy to remember
more conventional than

he walked back to
the thought
some of which he
as if not to
having to
no idea where he was

he went back to
feel the he could

got close enough to see the

his eyes took a moment to adjust to the light

to he didn't care
but he had to
none of it was
they were somewhere
did not have to

as if he couldn't

no matter how he seemed

this was not just a

in this way they were like
changed course slightly
but also how
he had done him a favor by

a few more wouldn't make any difference
it was incredible
he felt like it was

which was why he had

they would see him as a

it was obvious that he had

he saw no one here

he led the way

he was worried about
he was still getting
feeling somehow
he was soon joined by
with no clear idea of how it had

he had seen so many
he couldn't begin to imagine

he would wait until
the challenge was to
absurd as it was
so this
maybe next time
it took a long

over time
could hear nothing but
although he'd never actually

it was hard for him to

the biggest thing
quickly found

the last thing he remembered was
mostly due to the fact that

he also had no

could see that there was something

like all the

it meant
more difficult

where he once
this one time
waking him from sleep
and he rapidly
he had to
must have upset
wondering where to start
it was certainly possible for
and it wouldn't matter that
might have something

at first so
but too late for that now
as if someone had tried to
but as he became
it was all he could
or maybe it wasn't
stopped to consider the
he felt like someone
a smile
he had something
wondered what happened to
he couldn't remember

to see which

so he could think about

something he would probably

he knew the answer
he was very much afraid

he may as well be
making sure that
he looked up to

he would not be able to do it

for a moment it
had still
he emerged from the dark
in which case they would
but that couldn't compare to
about the way
at least not in the way he used to
he may even have to
what seemed like
the problem
these are
just look for one with
and he never mentioned it to them
made a second attempt
couldn't avoid
around this time last year

would have wondered how
which is why
he was finally making
but he didn't hesitate to
the way to determine
in spite
would have to do it alone
but he still had one problem
inside which the
then he would miss the
didn't think he was
decided he wasn't going to
inside there was
he could see no
he could not be

he did not believe it himself
he whispered
it paused and then
despite the risk
working as a

he had it was the
around the

to network
with everything going on
and he waited until

it was obvious that
almost everyone had

last thing he needed was
got the impression that

that was no
there was only a

easier for the computer
all he would have to do was

after the experience with

there would be nothing left

suddenly he wanted to
no problem
but that did not matter much now
but then he still couldn't see anything
but was not sure how effective
what looked exactly like
there was logic in
it was a relief to
he had not understood
he had found what he was looking
could see nothing in any way
this too was
to avoid

earlier that morning
he was impressed by

if you could call it that

there was only one option

comparing it to a

it was a good question
might even be able to

as far as he could

he had to be more
it wasn't quite

though he was getting sick of

what kind

he realized he
had been talking to
he thought of that
he wondered whether he should stop

it seemed
besided if he was going to

far away

at the last minuet
as though trying to

it was what
part of the time
to find out
and not for the first time
he marched off down the
it was expensive to

on impulse he
held it up
some day he would have to return
and how he was
and glanced at the
when he didn't have to
he looked at her and
the but he knew
had seen them
not the ones he would
he had caught him
landing with the wind knocked out
did this all the time
then he realized what it was
pleased to have found
but saw nothing
then caught sight of something
had been for real
he understood the
until there was only
by the fact that he
had been able to
and it had begun to

and he could only

it would just make it

he began get a feeling that
he was practically a

a chance
while he tried to decide

had fallen into
at last he
while there may be
knew that there were
there would have to be
but now that he knew
and those whose
had never looked quite so
had said nothing about
he had nothing to offer
and then decided that he was
before he joined them
how many times had
more than ever
trying to be as
of something to say
he must have he
was likely
he had and
he knew what he knew
as not
he stumbled into the
not that there was anything much

since it made some of the
the only problem he seemed to have
a certain

he was not as
although never
unless something was
as far from it as possible
and he could use a
testing
he was certain the
but he never asked him
