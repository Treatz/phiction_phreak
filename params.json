The project goal right now is to create binary releases for every platform. You can still download the windows binary through GitHub.\r\n\r\n![image](http://www.withoutrules.altervista.org/PhictionPhreak.png)\r\n\r\nCorey's website can be found at [www.streetwitch.com](http://www.streetwitch.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
