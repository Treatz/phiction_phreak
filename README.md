# phiction_phreak

Phiction Phreak was written in C++ using Qt. 
Qt runs on every platform including Linux and OSX, so the C++ code will compile on any system with minor changes.

The program was created by Corey White a.k.a "Treatz", but anyone can contribute. The project goal right now is to create binary releases for every platform. You can still download the windows binary through GitHub.
