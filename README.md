## Synopsis

Phiction Phreak is a database created to assist you in writing and developing fiction. Anything you write with Phiction Phreak is yours to keep with no attached licenses. It is intended to be used as a "ghost writer", so no mention of it has to be made when publishing the final version of your work. The software is built into a GUI that allows you to easily browse and search through the database. As a general rule, clicking on any word inside of the window will open up a new search for that term. You can search for anything, or view the entire database at once. There is also a list of the most common words in the database which allows you to sort through the database instead of search. 

## Motivation

Phiction Phreak was created because I wanted to write a novel and thought the best way to start would be to read everything I could get my hands on. I saved little pieces of what I read and over time they became a database. 

## Installation

If you want to compile Phiction Phreak, you will need to download Qt. Qt is a cross platform library and IDE that uses C++ to build world class applications. If you don't feel comfortable compiling the source code then you can download Windows and mac binaries and install it into any directory. 

After you download the program, conisder getting the latest database for Phiction Phreak.  New additions of the database are always being added, and won't necessarily be part of future binary releases.

Everything you need to install Phiction Phreak can be found on GitHub here: http://treatz.github.io/phiction_phreak/

## API Reference
