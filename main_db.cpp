db[1423]=" and just when ";
db[1424]=" and knew he was ";
db[1425]=" and knew it ";
db[1426]=" and knew more than a little about ";

db[1432]=" and left him the ";
db[1433]=" and left you that way until ";
db[1434]=" and less like a ";
db[1435]=" and like most ";
db[1436]=" and liked to ";
db[1437]=" and listening from time to time ";
db[1438]=" and locked the door before he left ";
db[1439]=" and looked ";

db[1450]=" and looked out ";
db[1451]=" and looked up nervously ";
db[1452]=" and looked visibly worried ";
db[1453]=" and lost his nerve ";
db[1454]=" and made ";

db[1462]=" and made them all ";
db[1463]=" and made use of ";
db[1464]=" and managed to ";
db[1465]=" and many ";
db[1466]=" and many more ";
db[1467]=" and maybe they had been when ";

db[1469]=" and might actually have been ";
db[1470]=" and might even ";
db[1471]=" and might have been only ";
db[1472]=" and more ";
db[1473]=" and more importantly ";
db[1474]=" and more importantly he could ";
db[1475]=" and more than a little ";
db[1476]=" and more than once he asked ";
db[1477]=" and most importantly ";
db[1478]=" and most of the time he ";
db[1479]=" and most were ";
db[1480]=" and moved through the ";
db[1481]=" and moved through the crowd ";
db[1482]=" and moving toward a ";
db[1483]=" and nearly ";
db[1484]=" and neither of them wanted to ";
db[1485]=" and never come back ";
db[1486]=" and never thought he ever would ";

db[1499]=" and not because he was ";

db[1501]=" and not for the first time ";
db[1502]=" and not just for the sake of ";
db[1503]=" and not just the ";
db[1504]=" and not long after ";
db[1505]=" and not only her ";
db[1506]=" and not quite ";
db[1507]=" and not quite like any he had ";

db[1573]=" and partly because he was ";
db[1574]=" and passed it to ";
db[1575]=" and perhaps ";
db[1576]=" and perhaps he ";

db[1584]=" and produced a ";
db[1585]=" and put them together ";
db[1586]=" and ran a hand through ";
db[1587]=" and rather different ";
db[1588]=" and rather more to the point ";
db[1589]=" and reached the ";
db[1590]=" and realized it was the ";
db[1591]=" and realized suddenly ";
db[1592]=" and realized that ";
db[1593]=" and realized that he hadn't ";
db[1594]=" and realized that he was right ";
db[1595]=" and realized what was ";
db[1596]=" and reminding him of the ";
db[1597]=" and required ";
db[1598]=" and return to ";
db[1599]=" and right now he ";
db[1600]=" and right now that was to ";
db[1601]=" and risk another ";
db[1602]=" and sat at a long table ";
db[1603]=" and sat down at the ";
db[1604]=" and saw ";
db[1605]=" and saw he ";
db[1606]=" and saw it in the ";
db[1607]=" and saw that ";
db[1608]=" and saw that he wasn't ";
db[1609]=" and saw where he was headed ";
db[1610]=" and scratched his beard ";
db[1611]=" and search for a way to ";
db[1612]=" and see what he was ";
db[1613]=" and seemed almost ";
db[1614]=" and seemed to ";
db[1615]=" and seemed to be ";
db[1616]=" and seeming to ";
db[1617]=" and seldom had he ";
db[1618]=" and sent him away before ";
db[1619]=" and sent him flying backward ";
db[1620]=" and sent them into the ";
db[1621]=" and separated by ";
db[1622]=" and settled down to ";
db[1623]=" and several ";
db[1624]=" and several had ";
db[1625]=" and several times he ";
db[1626]=" and several times he found himself ";
db[1627]=" and she was wearing a ";
db[1628]=" and showed plainly that he ";
db[1629]=" and silently ";
db[1630]=" and since he still had ";
db[1631]=" and slowly inched his way ";
db[1632]=" and smart enough to ";
db[1633]=" and smiled ";
db[1634]=" and so did ";
db[1635]=" and so did the others ";
db[1636]=" and so happened to be ";
db[1637]=" and so he continued ";
db[1638]=" and so he must be ";
db[1639]=" and so long as that ";
db[1640]=" and so long as the ";
db[1641]=" and so on ";
db[1642]=" and so on through ";
db[1643]=" and so on until ";
db[1644]=" and so the ";
db[1645]=" and so were the ";
db[1646]=" and so when he arrived ";
db[1647]=" and some ";
db[1648]=" and some had hardly ";
db[1649]=" and some increased energy ";
db[1650]=" and some of ";
db[1651]=" and some of the ";
db[1652]=" and some of them were ";
db[1653]=" and somehow he ";
db[1654]=" and somehow he couldn't ";
db[1655]=" and something else ";
db[1656]=" and sometimes he ";
db[1657]=" and soon ";
db[1658]=" and soon he was ";
db[1659]=" and soon they were ";
db[1660]=" and soon would ";
db[1661]=" and sooner or later ";
db[1662]=" and spent the rest of the ";
db[1663]=" and stared at the ";
db[1664]=" and started ";
db[1665]=" and stepped onto the ";
db[1666]=" and still ";
db[1667]=" and still he did not ";
db[1668]=" and still he made no sign of ";
db[1669]=" and still it went on ";
db[1670]=" and stood up from the ";
db[1671]=" and stopped in front of the ";
db[1672]=" and struggled to ";
db[1673]=" and struggling to ";
db[1674]=" and suddenly he knew ";
db[1675]=" and suddenly he was ";
db[1676]=" and sure enough ";
db[1677]=" and survived for a time ";
db[1678]=" and take his chances ";
db[1679]=" and that ";
db[1680]=" and that although ";
db[1681]=" and that bothered him far more than ";
db[1682]=" and that he ";
db[1683]=" and that he could ";
db[1684]=" and that he had not ";
db[1685]=" and that he had sufficient reason for ";
db[1686]=" and that if he believed in it ";
db[1687]=" and that is through ";
db[1688]=" and that meant ";
db[1689]=" and that meant only one thing ";
db[1690]=" and that seemed to ";
db[1691]=" and that surely meant ";
db[1692]=" and that the rest was ";
db[1693]=" and that there could be no ";
db[1694]=" and that there were far more ";
db[1695]=" and that was ";
db[1696]=" and that was a ";
db[1697]=" and that was a good sign ";
db[1698]=" and that was a wholly different ";
db[1699]=" and that was all that mattered ";
db[1700]=" and that was bound to be ";
db[1701]=" and that was enough ";
db[1702]=" and that was how ";
db[1703]=" and that was how he ";
db[1704]=" and that was just about ";
db[1705]=" and that was not his purpose here anyway ";
db[1706]=" and that was that ";
db[1707]=" and that was the ";
db[1708]=" and that was the end of ";
db[1709]=" and that was the only thing ";
db[1710]=" and that was what they had ";

db[1713]=" and that would be a ";
db[1714]=" and that would be very difficult ";
db[1715]=" and that wouldn't be too hard ";
db[1716]=" and that's what ";
db[1717]=" and the ";
db[1718]=" and the depths into which ";
db[1719]=" and the end of the ";
db[1720]=" and the entire ";
db[1721]=" and the fact that ";
db[1722]=" and the fact that it was ";

db[1724]=" and the following afternoon he ";
db[1725]=" and the idea of ";
db[1726]=" and the last had a ";
db[1727]=" and the last of the ";
db[1728]=" and the man ";
db[1729]=" and the mere fact that the ";
db[1730]=" and the moment had come ";
db[1731]=" and the one thing that ";
db[1732]=" and the only ";
db[1733]=" and the only reason that ";
db[1734]=" and the only way to ";
db[1735]=" and the others knew ";
db[1736]=" and the possibility of a ";

db[1740]=" and the same ";
db[1741]=" and the sight was ";
db[1742]=" and the thought of ";
db[1743]=" and the way he ";
db[1744]=" and the way was clear ";
db[1745]=" and the world began to ";
db[1746]=" and then ";
db[1747]=" and then abruptly ";

db[1753]=" and then go on to ";
db[1754]=" and then had ";
db[1755]=" and then he ";

db[1775]=" and then one day ";
db[1776]=" and then slipped a ";
